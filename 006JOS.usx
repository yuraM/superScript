<para style="imt1">Joshua and Judges</para>
<para style="im">The books of Joshua and Judges tell the story of Israel as a young nation. The Bibleʼs drama here moves to an important new stage—Godʼs people are in Godʼs land. But Israel struggles to live up to its high calling in Godʼs plan to regain his creation. These books describe how the Israelites conquered and occupied the land of Canaan, and how, once they settled there, they had to fight over and over again to regain their freedom from other peoples.</para>
<para style="ip">The book of Joshua begins by describing the preparations the united tribes made for their invasion of Canaan. It then reports how they conquered first the central part of this land, and then its northern and southern parts. The first half of the book is built out of a list of kings the Israelites defeat when they invade Canaan. Joshua leads them on a campaign against the first and greatest threat they face, the “royal cities” of the region. These cities have their own kings and are heavily fortified and defended. The narrative follows the army as it overcomes one city after another, describing at various lengths what happened at each place. At the end of the campaign, the original list itself is included in the text.</para>
<para style="ip">The book next looks at how the land was divided among the tribes. The length and detail of this section reveal how important it was for the clans and tribes to receive their specific inheritance and to be well placed in the new land (rather than be a displaced people). As at the first creation, God is making an appropriate home for his people. But the book also specifies that pockets of resistance remained. It therefore concludes with Joshua, in his final speech before his own death, urging each tribe to take full possession of its allotted territory. Joshua also led the people covenant they made with God before they entered the land.</para>
<para style="ip">After Joshuaʼs death, the individual tribes had only limited success in driving out the remaining Canaanites. And so they tried to live with them instead. They intermarried with them and even joined in worshipping Canaanite gods. This violated their covenant with God and aroused his anger. God allowed one nation after another to conquer the Israelites. The book of Judges describes how, when the people returned to God and cried out for help, he raised up “judges” to deliver them. These were both military leaders and legal authorities.</para>
<para style="ip">Unfortunately, the people remained faithful to God only during the judgeʼs lifetime. The phrase <char style="qt">again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> </char> is used repeatedly to introduce the stories of individual judges. Just as Israel was made up of twelve tribes, the book relates the careers of twelve judges, six of them in some detail. By the end of the book the pattern of recurring lapses can be recognized as inevitable. Israel has rejected their true Judge and Ruler, the <char style="nd">Lord</char>.</para>
<para style="ip">Judges explains the worsening anarchy and atrocities of the period by noting, <char style="qt">In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit.</char> The book is making a case for Israel having a king. But it also warns, by recounting the disastrous career of Abimelek, who is very much an “anti-judge,” that this must not be a Canaanite-style king who will brutally oppress his own people. Judges, in other words, points the struggling nation in the direction of the kind of human king who will be an extension of Godʼs own rule.</para>

<chapter number="1" style="c"/>
<para style="s1">Joshua Installed as Leader</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>After the death of Moses the servant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua son of Nun, Mosesʼ aide: <verse number="2" style="v"/>“Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them — to the Israelites. <verse number="3" style="v"/>I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses. <verse number="4" style="v"/>Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates — all the Hittite country — to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. <verse number="5" style="v"/>No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you. <verse number="6" style="v"/>Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v"/>“Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go. <verse number="8" style="v"/>Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful. <verse number="9" style="v"/>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God will be with you wherever you go.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v"/>So Joshua ordered the officers of the people: <verse number="11" style="v"/>“Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Get your provisions ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God is giving you for your own.’ ”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, <verse number="13" style="v"/>“Remember the command that Moses the servant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> gave you after he said, ‘The <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God will give you rest by giving you this land.’ <verse number="14" style="v"/>Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, ready for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites. You are to help them <verse number="15" style="v"/>until the <char style="nd">Lord</char> gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v"/>Then they answered Joshua, “Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. <verse number="17" style="v"/>Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God be with you as he was with Moses. <verse number="18" style="v"/>Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey it, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!”</para>
<chapter number="2" style="c"/>
<para style="s1">Rahab and the Spies</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. “Go, look over the land,” he said, “especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v"/>The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.” <verse number="3" style="v"/>So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v"/>But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from. <verse number="5" style="v"/>At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left. I donʼt know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.” <verse number="6" style="v"/>(But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.) <verse number="7" style="v"/>So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v"/>Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof <verse number="9" style="v"/>and said to them, “I know that the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you. <verse number="10" style="v"/>We have heard how the <char style="nd">Lord</char> dried up the water of the Red Sea<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:10 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">the Sea of Reeds</char></note> for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:10 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, often by totally destroying them.</char></note> <verse number="11" style="v"/>When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyoneʼs courage failed because of you, for the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>“Now then, please swear to me by the <char style="nd">Lord</char> that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign <verse number="13" style="v"/>that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them — and that you will save us from death.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v"/>“Our lives for your lives!” the men assured her. “If you donʼt tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the <char style="nd">Lord</char> gives us the land.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v"/>So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall. <verse number="16" style="v"/>She said to them, “Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v"/>Now the men had said to her, “This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us <verse number="18" style="v"/>unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house. <verse number="19" style="v"/>If any of them go outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own heads; we will not be responsible. As for those who are in the house with you, their blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on them. <verse number="20" style="v"/>But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v"/>“Agreed,” she replied. “Let it be as you say.”</para>
<para style="p">So she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v"/>When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them. <verse number="23" style="v"/>Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them. <verse number="24" style="v"/>They said to Joshua, “The <char style="nd">Lord</char> has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us.”</para>
<chapter number="3" style="c"/>
<para style="s1">Crossing the Jordan</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over. <verse number="2" style="v"/>After three days the officers went throughout the camp, <verse number="3" style="v"/>giving orders to the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God, and the Levitical priests carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it. <verse number="4" style="v"/>Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:4 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">That is, about 3,000 feet or about 900 meters</char></note> between you and the ark; do not go near it.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v"/>Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the <char style="nd">Lord</char> will do amazing things among you.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v"/>Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people.” So they took it up and went ahead of them.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v"/>And the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses. <verse number="8" style="v"/>Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the Jordanʼs waters, go and stand in the river.’ ”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v"/>Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God. <verse number="10" style="v"/>This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites. <verse number="11" style="v"/>See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you. <verse number="12" style="v"/>Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> — the Lord of all the earth — set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v"/>So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them. <verse number="15" style="v"/>Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the waterʼs edge, <verse number="16" style="v"/>the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho. <verse number="17" style="v"/>The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> stopped in the middle of the Jordan and stood on dry ground, while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground.</para>
<chapter number="4" style="c"/>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, <verse number="2" style="v"/>“Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe, <verse number="3" style="v"/>and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from right where the priests are standing, and carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v"/>So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe, <verse number="5" style="v"/>and said to them, “Go over before the ark of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, <verse number="6" style="v"/>to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, ‘What do these stones mean?’ <verse number="7" style="v"/>tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v"/>So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down. <verse number="9" style="v"/>Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">4:9 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">Joshua also set up twelve stones</char></note> in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v"/>Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over, <verse number="11" style="v"/>and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and the priests came to the other side while the people watched. <verse number="12" style="v"/>The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, ready for battle, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them. <verse number="13" style="v"/>About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the <char style="nd">Lord</char> to the plains of Jericho for war.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v"/>That day the <char style="nd">Lord</char> exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they stood in awe of him all the days of his life, just as they had stood in awe of Moses.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v"/>Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, <verse number="16" style="v"/>“Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant law to come up out of the Jordan.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v"/>So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v"/>And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v"/>On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho. <verse number="20" style="v"/>And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan. <verse number="21" style="v"/>He said to the Israelites, “In the future when your descendants ask their parents, ‘What do these stones mean?’ <verse number="22" style="v"/>tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’ <verse number="23" style="v"/>For the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God did to the Jordan what he had done to the Red Sea<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">4:23 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">the Sea of Reeds</char></note> when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over. <verse number="24" style="v"/>He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> is powerful and so that you might always fear the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God.”</para>
<chapter number="5" style="c"/>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until they<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">5:1 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Another textual tradition </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">we</char></note> had crossed over, their hearts melted in fear and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.</para>
<para style="s1">Circumcision and Passover at Gilgal</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v"/>At that time the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again.” <verse number="3" style="v"/>So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">5:3 </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Gibeath Haaraloth </char><char style="ft" closed="false">means the hill of foreskins.</char></note></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v"/>Now this is why he did so: All those who came out of Egypt — all the men of military age — died in the wilderness on the way after leaving Egypt. <verse number="5" style="v"/>All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness during the journey from Egypt had not. <verse number="6" style="v"/>The Israelites had moved about in the wilderness forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. For the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had sworn to them that they would not see the land he had solemnly promised their ancestors to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. <verse number="7" style="v"/>So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way. <verse number="8" style="v"/>And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v"/>Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So the place has been called Gilgal<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">5:9 </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Gilgal </char><char style="ft" closed="false">sounds like the Hebrew for roll.</char></note> to this day.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v"/>On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover. <verse number="11" style="v"/>The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain. <verse number="12" style="v"/>The manna stopped the day after<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">5:12 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">the day</char></note> they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate the produce of Canaan.</para>
<para style="s1">The Fall of Jericho</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v"/>Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, “Are you for us or for our enemies?”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v"/>“Neither,” he replied, “but as commander of the army of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> I have now come.” Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, “What message does my Lord<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">5:14 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">lord</char></note> have for his servant?”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v"/>The commander of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>ʼs army replied, “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.</para>
<chapter number="6" style="c"/>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Now the gates of Jericho were securely barred because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v"/>Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men. <verse number="3" style="v"/>March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. <verse number="4" style="v"/>Have seven priests carry trumpets of ramsʼ horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. <verse number="5" style="v"/>When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v"/>So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it.” <verse number="7" style="v"/>And he ordered the army, “Advance! March around the city, with an armed guard going ahead of the ark of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v"/>When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the <char style="nd">Lord</char> went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>ʼs covenant followed them. <verse number="9" style="v"/>The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding. <verse number="10" style="v"/>But Joshua had commanded the army, “Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!” <verse number="11" style="v"/>So he had the ark of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> carried around the city, circling it once. Then the army returned to camp and spent the night there.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. <verse number="13" style="v"/>The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, while the trumpets kept sounding. <verse number="14" style="v"/>So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v"/>On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times. <verse number="16" style="v"/>The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the army, “Shout! For the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has given you the city! <verse number="17" style="v"/>The city and all that is in it are to be devoted<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">6:17 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, often by totally destroying them; also in verses 18 and 21.</char></note> to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent. <verse number="18" style="v"/>But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it. <verse number="19" style="v"/>All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and must go into his treasury.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v"/>When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so everyone charged straight in, and they took the city. <verse number="21" style="v"/>They devoted the city to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it — men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v"/>Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostituteʼs house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her.” <verse number="23" style="v"/>So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother, her brothers and sisters and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v"/>Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>ʼs house. <verse number="25" style="v"/>But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho — and she lives among the Israelites to this day.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v"/>At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: “Cursed before the <char style="nd">Lord</char> is the one who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho:</para>

<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v"/>Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the region.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v"/>When they returned to Joshua, they said, “Not all the army will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary the whole army, for only a few people live there.” <verse number="4" style="v"/>So about three thousand went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai, <verse number="5" style="v"/>who killed about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted in fear and became like water.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v"/>Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads. <verse number="7" style="v"/>And Joshua said, “Alas, Sovereign <char style="nd">Lord</char>, why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan! <verse number="8" style="v"/>Pardon your servant, Lord. What can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies? <verse number="9" style="v"/>The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth.

<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v"/>The <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “Stand up!

They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions. <verse number="12" style="v"/>That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v"/>“Go, consecrate the people.

<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v"/>Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was chosen. <verse number="17" style="v"/>The clans of Judah came forward, and the Zerahites were chosen. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was chosen. <verse number="18" style="v"/>Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was chosen.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v"/>Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Israel, and honor him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v"/>Achan replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Israel.

<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v"/>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. <verse number="23" style="v"/>They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the <char style="nd">Lord</char>.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v"/>Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor. <verse number="25" style="v"/>Joshua said, “Why have you brought this trouble on us?

<para style="p">Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them. <verse number="26" style="v"/>Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day.

<chapter number="8" style="c"/>
<para style="s1">Ai Destroyed</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v"/>Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land. <verse number="2" style="v"/>You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v"/>So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night <verse number="4" style="v"/>with these orders: “Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Donʼt go very far from it. All of you be on the alert. <verse number="5" style="v"/>I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them. <verse number="6" style="v"/>They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are running away from us as they did before.’ So when we flee from them, <verse number="7" style="v"/>you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God will give it into your hand. <verse number="8" style="v"/>When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has commanded. See to it; you have my orders.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v"/>Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai — but Joshua spent that night with the people.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v"/>Early the next morning Joshua mustered his army, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai. <verse number="11" style="v"/>The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city. <verse number="12" style="v"/>Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. <verse number="13" style="v"/>So the soldiers took up their positions — with the main camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v"/>When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city. <verse number="15" style="v"/>Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the wilderness. <verse number="16" style="v"/>All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city. <verse number="17" style="v"/>Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v"/>Then the <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city.” So Joshua held out toward the city the javelin that was in his hand. <verse number="19" style="v"/>As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v"/>The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising up into the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction; the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the wilderness had turned back against their pursuers. <verse number="21" style="v"/>For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from it, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai. <verse number="22" style="v"/>Those in the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives. <verse number="23" style="v"/>But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v"/>When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it. <verse number="25" style="v"/>Twelve thousand men and women fell that day — all the people of Ai. <verse number="26" style="v"/>For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">8:26 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The Hebrew term refers to the irrevocable giving over of things or persons to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, often by totally destroying them.</char></note> all who lived in Ai. <verse number="27" style="v"/>But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had instructed Joshua.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v"/>So Joshua burned Ai<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">8:28 </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Ai </char><char style="ft" closed="false">means the ruin.</char></note> and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day. <verse number="29" style="v"/>He impaled the body of the king of Ai on a pole and left it there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take the body from the pole and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day.</para>
<para style="s1">The Covenant Renewed at Mount Ebal</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="30" style="v"/>Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Israel, <verse number="31" style="v"/>as Moses the servant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses — an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool had been used. On it they offered to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings. <verse number="32" style="v"/>There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the law of Moses. <verse number="33" style="v"/>All the Israelites, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, facing the Levitical priests who carried it. Both the foreigners living among them and the native-born were there. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of Israel.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="34" style="v"/>Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law — the blessings and the curses — just as it is written in the Book of the Law. <verse number="35" style="v"/>There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the foreigners who lived among them.</para>
<chapter number="9" style="c"/>
<para style="s1">The Gibeonite Deception</para>

<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v"/>However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, <verse number="4" style="v"/>they resorted to a ruse: They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">9:4 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Most Hebrew manuscripts; some Hebrew manuscripts, Vulgate and Syriac (see also Septuagint) </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">They prepared provisions and loaded their donkeys</char></note> with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended. <verse number="5" style="v"/>They put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy. <verse number="6" style="v"/>Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the Israelites, “We have come from a distant country; make a treaty with us.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v"/>The Israelites said to the Hivites, “But perhaps you live near us, so how can we make a treaty with you?”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v"/>“We are your servants,” they said to Joshua.</para>
<para style="p">But Joshua asked, “Who are you and where do you come from?”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v"/>They answered: “Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God. For we have heard reports of him: all that he did in Egypt, <verse number="10" style="v"/>and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan — Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth. <verse number="11" style="v"/>And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, “We are your servants; make a treaty with us.” ’ <verse number="12" style="v"/>This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is. <verse number="13" style="v"/>And these wineskins that we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v"/>The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>. <verse number="15" style="v"/>Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v"/>Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard that they were neighbors, living near them. <verse number="17" style="v"/>So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim. <verse number="18" style="v"/>But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Israel.</para>
<para style="p">The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders, <verse number="19" style="v"/>but all the leaders answered, “We have given them our oath by the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them now. <verse number="20" style="v"/>This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that Godʼs wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them.” <verse number="21" style="v"/>They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers in the service of the whole assembly.” So the leadersʼ promise to them was kept.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v"/>Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by saying, ‘We live a long way from you,’ while actually you live near us? <verse number="23" style="v"/>You are now under a curse: You will never be released from service as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v"/>They answered Joshua, “Your servants were clearly told how the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this. <verse number="25" style="v"/>We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v"/>So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them. <verse number="27" style="v"/>That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the assembly, to provide for the needs of the altar of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> at the place the <char style="nd">Lord</char> would choose.

<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v"/>Then the five kings of the Amorites — the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon — joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v"/>The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: “Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us.”</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v"/>So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men. <verse number="8" style="v"/>The <char style="nd">Lord</char> said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand.

<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v"/>After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise. <verse number="10" style="v"/>The <char style="nd">Lord</char> threw them into confusion before Israel, so Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely at Gibeon.

<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v"/>On the day the <char style="nd">Lord</char> gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> in the presence of Israel:</para>

<para style="s1">Five Amorite Kings Killed</para>

<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v"/>So Joshua and the Israelites defeated them completely, but a few survivors managed to reach their fortified cities. <verse number="21" style="v"/>The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites.</para>
<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v"/>Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.” <verse number="23" style="v"/>So they brought the five kings out of the cave — the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon. <verse number="24" style="v"/>When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.</para>
