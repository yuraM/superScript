<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.1"><v id="1"></v>James the servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.2"><v id="2"></v>My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.3"><v id="3"></v>Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.4"><v id="4"></v>And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.5"><v id="5"></v>But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.6"><v id="6"></v>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.7"><v id="7"></v>Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.8"><v id="8"></v>A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.9"><v id="9"></v>But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.10"><v id="10"></v>And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.11"><v id="11"></v>For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.12"><v id="12"></v>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.13"><v id="13"></v>Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.14"><v id="14"></v>But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.15"><v id="15"></v>Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.16"><v id="16"></v>Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.17"><v id="17"></v>Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.18"><v id="18"></v>For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creatures. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.19"><v id="19"></v>You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.20"><v id="20"></v>For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.21"><v id="21"></v>Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.22"><v id="22"></v>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.23"><v id="23"></v>For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.24"><v id="24"></v>For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.25"><v id="25"></v>But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.26"><v id="26"></v>And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man's religion is vain. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.1.27"><v id="27"></v>Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one's self unspotted from this world. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.1"><v id="1"></v>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.2"><v id="2"></v>For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and shall say to him: Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.4"><v id="4"></v>Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.5"><v id="5"></v>Hearken, my dearest brethren: hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.6"><v id="6"></v>But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.7"><v id="7"></v>Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.8"><v id="8"></v>If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.9"><v id="9"></v>But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.10"><v id="10"></v>And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.11"><v id="11"></v>For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.12"><v id="12"></v>So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.13"><v id="13"></v>For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.14"><v id="14"></v>What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.15"><v id="15"></v>And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.16"><v id="16"></v>And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.17"><v id="17"></v>So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.18"><v id="18"></v>But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.19"><v id="19"></v>Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.20"><v id="20"></v>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.21"><v id="21"></v>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.22"><v id="22"></v>Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.23"><v id="23"></v>And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.24"><v id="24"></v>Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.25"><v id="25"></v>And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.2.26"><v id="26"></v>For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.1"><v id="1"></v>Be ye not many masters, my brethren, knowing that you receive the greater judgment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.2"><v id="2"></v>For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.3"><v id="3"></v>For if we put bits into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.4"><v id="4"></v>Behold also ships, whereas they are great, and are driven by strong winds, yet are they turned about with a small helm, whithersoever the force of the governor willeth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.5"><v id="5"></v>Even so the tongue is indeed a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.6"><v id="6"></v>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is placed among our members, which defileth the whole body, and inflameth the wheel of our nativity, being set on fire by hell. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.7"><v id="7"></v>For every nature of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of the rest, is tamed, and hath been tamed, by the nature of man: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.8"><v id="8"></v>But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly poison. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.9"><v id="9"></v>By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.10"><v id="10"></v>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.11"><v id="11"></v>Doth a fountain send forth, out of the same hole, sweet and bitter water? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.12"><v id="12"></v>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear grapes; or the vine, figs? So neither can the salt water yield sweet. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.13"><v id="13"></v>Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew, by a good conversation, his work in the meekness of wisdom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.14"><v id="14"></v>But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contentions in your hearts; glory not, and be not liars against the truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.15"><v id="15"></v>For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.16"><v id="16"></v>For where envying and contention is, there is inconstancy, and every evil work. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.17"><v id="17"></v>But the wisdom, that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="59.3.18"><v id="18"></v>And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that make peace. </bcv></p0>
