<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.1"><v id="1"></v>These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into Egypt with Jacob: they went in, every man with his household: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.2"><v id="2"></v>Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.3"><v id="3"></v>Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.4"><v id="4"></v>Dan, and Nephtali, Gad and Aser. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.5"><v id="5"></v>And all the souls that came out of Jacob's thigh, were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.6"><v id="6"></v>After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.7"><v id="7"></v>The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.8"><v id="8"></v>In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.9"><v id="9"></v>And he said to his people: Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.10"><v id="10"></v>Come, let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.11"><v id="11"></v>Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens, and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom and Ramesses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.12"><v id="12"></v>But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied, and increased: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.13"><v id="13"></v>And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted them and mocked them: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.14"><v id="14"></v>And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay, and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.15"><v id="15"></v>And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews: of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.16"><v id="16"></v>Commanding them: When you shall do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery is come: if it be a man child, kill it: if a woman, keep it alive. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.17"><v id="17"></v>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men children. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.18"><v id="18"></v>And the king called for them and said: What is that you meant to do, that you would save the men children ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.19"><v id="19"></v>They answered: The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they themselves are skillful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.20"><v id="20"></v>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.21"><v id="21"></v>And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.1.22"><v id="22"></v>Pharao therefore charged all his people, saying: Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river: whatsoever of the female, ye shall save alive. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.1"><v id="1"></v>After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife of his own kindred. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.2"><v id="2"></v>And she conceived, and bore a son; and seeing him a goodly child hid him three months. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river's brink, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.4"><v id="4"></v>His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.5"><v id="5"></v>And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river's brink. And when she saw the basket in the sedges, she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.6"><v id="6"></v>She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.7"><v id="7"></v>And the child's sister said to her Shall I go and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.8"><v id="8"></v>She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.9"><v id="9"></v>And Pharao's daughter said to her. Take this child and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman took, and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao's daughter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.10"><v id="10"></v>And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.11"><v id="11"></v>In those days after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews his brethren. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.12"><v id="12"></v>And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.13"><v id="13"></v>And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarreling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.14"><v id="14"></v>But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us: wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.15"><v id="15"></v>And Pharao heard of this word and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.16"><v id="16"></v>And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father's flocks. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.17"><v id="17"></v>And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.18"><v id="18"></v>And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.19"><v id="19"></v>They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.20"><v id="20"></v>But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.21"><v id="21"></v>And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.22"><v id="22"></v>And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father, my helper hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.23"><v id="23"></v>Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.24"><v id="24"></v>And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.2.25"><v id="25"></v>And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.1"><v id="1"></v>Now Moses fed the sheep of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Madian: and he drove the flock to the inner parts of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, Horeb. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.2"><v id="2"></v>And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he saw that the bush was on fire and was not burnt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.3"><v id="3"></v>And Moses said: I will go and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.4"><v id="4"></v>And when the Lord saw that he went forward to see, he called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said: Moses, Moses. And he answered: Here I am. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.5"><v id="5"></v>And he said: Come not nigh hither, put off the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.6"><v id="6"></v>And he said: I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Moses hid his face: for he durst not look at God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.7"><v id="7"></v>And the Lord said to him: I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of the rigour of them that are over the works: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.8"><v id="8"></v>And knowing their sorrow, I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land into a good and spacious land, into a land that floweth with milk and honey, to the places of the Chanaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.9"><v id="9"></v>For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have seen their affliction, wherewith they are oppressed by the Egyptians. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.10"><v id="10"></v>But come, and I will send thee to Pharao, that thou mayst bring forth my people, the children of Israel out of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.11"><v id="11"></v>And Moses said to God: Who am I that I should go to Pharao, and should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.12"><v id="12"></v>And he said to him: I will be with thee: and this thou shalt have for a sign, that I have sent thee: When thou shalt have brought my people out of Egypt, thou shalt offer sacrifice to God upon this mountain. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.13"><v id="13"></v>Moses said to God: Lo, I shall go to the children of Israel, and say to them: The God of your fathers hath sent me to you. If they should say to me: What is his name? what shall I say to them? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.14"><v id="14"></v>God said to Moses: I AM WHO AM. He said: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: HE WHO IS, hath sent me to you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.15"><v id="15"></v>And God said again to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.16"><v id="16"></v>Go, gather together the ancients of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying: Visiting I have visited you: and I have seen all that hath befallen you in Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.17"><v id="17"></v>And I have said the word to bring you forth out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Chanaanite, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite, to a land that floweth with milk and honey. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.18"><v id="18"></v>And they shall hear thy voice: and thou shalt go in, thou and the ancients of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews hath called us: we will go three days' journey into the wilderness, to sacrifice unto the Lord our God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.19"><v id="19"></v>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, but by a mighty hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.20"><v id="20"></v>For I will stretch forth my hand and will strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of them: after these he will let you go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.21"><v id="21"></v>And I will give favour to this people, in the sight of the Egyptians: and when you go forth, you shall not depart empty: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.3.22"><v id="22"></v>But every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that is in her house, vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons and daughters, and shall spoil Egypt. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.2"><v id="2"></v>Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rod. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.3"><v id="3"></v>And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent: so that Moses fled from it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.4"><v id="4"></v>And the Lord said: Put out thy hand and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.5"><v id="5"></v>That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.6"><v id="6"></v>And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.7"><v id="7"></v>And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.8"><v id="8"></v>If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.9"><v id="9"></v>But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river shall be turned into blood. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.10"><v id="10"></v>Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord. I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before: and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.11"><v id="11"></v>The Lord said to him: Who made man's mouth? or who made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? did not I? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.12"><v id="12"></v>Go therefore and I will be in thy mouth: and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.17"><v id="17"></v>And take this rod in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.18"><v id="18"></v>Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law and said to him: I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro said to him: Go in peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.19"><v id="19"></v>And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian: Go, and return into Egypt: for they are all dead that sought thy life. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.20"><v id="20"></v>Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass: and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of God in his hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.21"><v id="21"></v>And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt: See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I have put in thy hand: I shall harden his heart, and he will not let the people go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.4.22"><v id="22"></v>And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Israel is my son, my firstborn. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.2"><v id="2"></v>But he answered: Who is the Lord, that I should hear his voice, and let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.3"><v id="3"></v>And they said: The God of the Hebrews hath called us, to go three days' journey into the wilderness and to sacrifice to the Lord our God: lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.4"><v id="4"></v>The king of Egypt said to them: Why do you Moses and Aaron draw off the people from their works? Get you gone to your burdens. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.5"><v id="5"></v>And Pharao said: The people of the land is numerous: you see that the multitude is increased: how much more if you give them rest from their works? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.6"><v id="6"></v>Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works, and the taskmasters of the people, saying: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.8"><v id="8"></v>And you shall lay upon them the task of bricks, which they did before, neither shall you diminish any thing thereof: for they are idle, and therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.9"><v id="9"></v>Let them be oppressed, with works, and let them fulfill them: that they may not regard lying words. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.10"><v id="10"></v>And the overseers of the works and the taskmasters went out and said to the people: Thus saith Pharao, I allow you no straw: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.14"><v id="14"></v>And they that were over the works of the children of Israel were scourged by Pharao's taskmasters, saying: Why have you not made up the task of bricks both yesterday and to day as before? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.15"><v id="15"></v>And the officers of the children of Israel came, and cried out to Pharao, saying: Why dealest thou so with thy servants? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.16"><v id="16"></v>Straw is not given us, and bricks are required of us as before: behold we thy servants are beaten with whips, and thy people is unjustly dealt withal. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.17"><v id="17"></v>And he said: You are idle, and therefore you say: Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.18"><v id="18"></v>Go therefore, and work: straw shall not be given you, and you shall deliver the accustomed number of bricks. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.5.19"><v id="19"></v>And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, because it was said to them: There shall not a whit be diminished of the bricks for every day. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.6.2"><v id="2"></v>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: I am the Lord, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.6.4"><v id="4"></v>And I made a covenant with them, to give them the land of Chanaan, the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.6.5"><v id="5"></v>I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, wherewith the Egyptians have oppressed them: and I have remembered my covenant. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.6.9"><v id="9"></v>And Moses told all this to the children of Israel: but they did not hearken to him, for anguish of spirit, and most painful work. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.7.4"><v id="4"></v>And he will not hear you: and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and will bring forth my army and my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, by very great judgments. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.7.5"><v id="5"></v>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, who have stretched forth my hand upon Egypt, and have brought forth the children of Israel out of the midst of them. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.7.10"><v id="10"></v>So Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharao, and did as the Lord had commanded. And Aaron took the rod before Pharao, and his servants, and it was turned into a serpent. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.7.11"><v id="11"></v>And Pharao called the wise men and the magicians: and they also by Egyptian enchantments and certain secrets did in like manner. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.7.14"><v id="14"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: Pharao's heart is hardened, he will not let the people go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.7.15"><v id="15"></v>Go to him in the morning, behold he will go out to the waters: and thou shalt stand to meet him on the bank of the river: and thou shalt take in thy hand the rod that was turned into a serpent. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.7.18"><v id="18"></v>And the fishes that are in the river shall die, and the waters shall be corrupted, and the Egyptians shall be afflicted when they drink the water of the river. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.7.19"><v id="19"></v>The Lord also said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, and upon their rivers, and streams and pools, and all the ponds of waters, that they may be turned into blood: and let blood be in all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and of stone. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.8.21"><v id="21"></v>But if thou wilt not let them go, behold I will send in upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy houses all kind of flies: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with flies of divers kinds, and the whole land wherein they shall be. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.2"><v id="2"></v>And thou mayest tell in the ears of thy sons, and of they grandsons, how often I have plagued the Egyptians, and wrought my signs amongst them: and you may know that I am the Lord: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.3"><v id="3"></v>Therefore Moses and Aaron went in to Pharao, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: How long refusest thou to submit to me? let my people go, to sacrifice to me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.4"><v id="4"></v>But if thou resist, and wilt not let them go, behold I will bring in to morrow the locust into thy coasts: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.5"><v id="5"></v>To cover the face of the earth that nothing thereof may appear, but that which the hail hath left may be eaten: for they shall feed upon all the trees that spring in the fields. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.6"><v id="6"></v>And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of thy servants, and of all the Egyptians: such a number as thy fathers have not seen, nor thy grandfathers, from the time they were first upon the earth, until this present day. And he turned himself away, and went forth from Pharao. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.7"><v id="7"></v>And Pharao's servants said to him: How long shall we endure this scandal? let the men go to sacrifice to the Lord their God. Dost thou not see that Egypt is undone? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.8"><v id="8"></v>And they called back Moses and Aaron to Pharao: and he said to them: Go, sacrifice to the Lord your God: who are they that shall go? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.9"><v id="9"></v>Moses said: We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, with our sheep and herds: for it is the solemnity of the Lord our God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.10"><v id="10"></v>And Pharao answered: So be the Lord with you, as I shall let you and your children go: who can doubt but that you intend some great evil? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.11"><v id="11"></v>It shall not be so: but go ye men only, and sacrifice to the Lord: for this yourselves also desired. And immediately they were cast out from Pharao's presence. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.12"><v id="12"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand upon the land of Egypt unto the locust, that it may come upon it, and devour every herb that is left after the hail. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.13"><v id="13"></v>And Moses stretched forth his rod upon the land of Egypt: and the Lord brought a burning wind all that day, and night: and when it was morning, the burning wind raised the locusts: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.14"><v id="14"></v>And they came up over the whole land of Egypt: and rested in all the coasts of the Egyptians innumerable, the like as had not been before that time, nor shall be hereafter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.15"><v id="15"></v>And they covered the whole face of the earth, wasting all things. And the grass of the earth was devoured, and what fruits soever were on the trees, which the hail had left: and there remained not any thing that was green on the trees, or in the herbs of the earth in all Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.16"><v id="16"></v>Wherefore Pharao in haste called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.17"><v id="17"></v>But now forgive me my sin this time also, and pray to the Lord your God, that he take away from me this death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.18"><v id="18"></v>And Moses going forth from the presence of Pharao, prayed to the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.19"><v id="19"></v>And he made a very strong wind to blow from the west, and it took the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea: there remained not so much as one in all the coasts of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.20"><v id="20"></v>And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, neither did he let the children of Israel go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.21"><v id="21"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch out they hand towards heaven: and may there be darkness upon the land of Egypt, so thick that it may be felt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.22"><v id="22"></v>And Moses stretch forth his hand towards heaven: and there came horrible darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.23"><v id="23"></v>No man saw his brother, nor moved himself out of the place where he was: but wheresoever the children of Israel dwelt there was light. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.24"><v id="24"></v>And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: Go sacrifice to the Lord: let your sheep only, and herds remain; let your children go with you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.25"><v id="25"></v>Moses said: Thou shalt give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, to the Lord our God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.26"><v id="26"></v>All the flocks shall go with us: there shall not a hoof remain of them: for they are necessary for the service of the Lord our God: especially as we know not what must be offered, till we come to the very place. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.27"><v id="27"></v>And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he would not let them go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.28"><v id="28"></v>And Pharao said to Moses: Get thee from me, and beware thou see not my face any more: in what day soever thou shalt come in my sight, thou shalt die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.10.29"><v id="29"></v>Moses answered: So shall it be as thou hast spoken, I will not see thy face any more. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.11.2"><v id="2"></v>Therefore thou shalt tell all the people that every man ask of his friend, and every woman of her neighbour, vessels of silver, and of gold. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.11.3"><v id="3"></v>And the Lord will give favour to his people in the sight of the Egyptians. And Moses was a very great man in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharao's servants, and of all the people. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.11.6"><v id="6"></v>And there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as neither hath been before, nor shall be hereafter. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.11.8"><v id="8"></v>And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and shall worship me, saying: Go forth thou, and all the people that is under thee: after that we will go out. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.11.9"><v id="9"></v>And he went out from Pharao exceeding angry. But the Lord said to Moses: Pharao will not hear you, that many signs may be done in the land of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.11.10"><v id="10"></v>And Moses and Aaron did all the wonders that are written, before Pharao. And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, neither did he let the children of Israel go out of his land. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.3"><v id="3"></v>Speak ye to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and say to them: On the tenth day of this month let every man take a lamb by their families and houses. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.24"><v id="24"></v>Thou shalt keep this thing as a law for thee and thy children for ever. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.30"><v id="30"></v>And Pharao arose in the night, and all his servants, and all Egypt: for there was not a house wherein there lay not one dead. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.31"><v id="31"></v>And Pharao calling Moses and Aaron, in the night, said: Arise and go forth from among my people, you and the children of Israel: go, sacrifice to the Lord as you say. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.32"><v id="32"></v>Your sheep and herds take along with you, as you demanded, and departing, bless me. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.34"><v id="34"></v>The people therefore took dough before it was leavened: and tying it in their cloaks, put it on their shoulders. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.35"><v id="35"></v>And the children of Israel did as Moses had commanded: and they asked of the Egyptians vessels of silver and gold, and very much raiment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.36"><v id="36"></v>And the Lord gave favour to the people in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them: and they stripped the Egyptians. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.37"><v id="37"></v>And the children of Israel set forward from Ramesse to Socoth, being about six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.39"><v id="39"></v>And they baked the meal, which a little before they had brought out of Egypt, in dough: and they made earth cakes unleavened: for it could not be leavened, the Egyptians pressing them to depart, and not suffering them to make any stay: neither did they think of preparing any meat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.40"><v id="40"></v>And the abode of the children of Israel that they made in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.42"><v id="42"></v>This is the observable night of the Lord, when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: this night all the children of Israel must observe in their generations. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.43"><v id="43"></v>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the service of the Phase: No foreigner shall eat of it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.44"><v id="44"></v>But every bought servant shall be circumcised, and so shall eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.45"><v id="45"></v>The stranger and the hireling shall not eat thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.46"><v id="46"></v>In one house shall it be eaten, neither shall you carry forth of the flesh thereof out of the house, neither shall you break a bone thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.47"><v id="47"></v>All the assembly of the children of Israel shall keep it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.48"><v id="48"></v>And if any stranger be willing to dwell among you, and to keep the Phase of the Lord, all his males shall first be circumcised, and then shall he celebrate it according to the manner: and he shall be as he that is born in the land: but if any man be uncircumcised, he shall not eat thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.49"><v id="49"></v>The same law shall be to him that is born in the land, and to the proselyte that sojourneth with you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.12.50"><v id="50"></v>And all the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.7"><v id="7"></v>And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots that were in Egypt: and the captains of the whole army. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.8"><v id="8"></v>And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel: but they were gone forth in a mighty hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.9"><v id="9"></v>And when the Egyptians followed the steps of them who were gone before, they found them encamped at the sea side: all Pharao's horse and chariots, and the whole army were in Phihahiroth before Beelsephon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.10"><v id="10"></v>And when Pharao drew near, the children of Israel, lifting up their eyes, saw the Egyptians behind them: and they feared exceedingly, and cried to the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.11"><v id="11"></v>And they said to Moses: Perhaps there were no graves in Egypt, therefore thou hast brought us to die in the wilderness: why wouldst thou do this, to lead us out of Egypt? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.12"><v id="12"></v>Is not this the word that we spoke to thee in Egypt, saying: Depart from us that we may serve the Egyptians? for it was much better to serve them, than to die in the wilderness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.13"><v id="13"></v>And Moses said to the people: Fear not: stand and see the great wonders of the Lord, which he will do this day: for the Egyptians, whom you see now, you shall see no more for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.14"><v id="14"></v>The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.15"><v id="15"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: Why criest thou to me? Speak to the children of Israel to go forward. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.16"><v id="16"></v>But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand over the sea, and divide it: that the children of Israel may go through the midst of the sea on dry ground. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.17"><v id="17"></v>And I will harden the heart of the Egyptians to pursue you: and I will be glorified in Pharao, and in all his host, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.18"><v id="18"></v>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall be glorified in Pharao, and in his chariots and in his horsemen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.19"><v id="19"></v>And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removing, went behind them: and together with him the pillar of the cloud, leaving the forepart, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.20"><v id="20"></v>Stood behind, between the Egyptians' camp and the camp of Israel: and it was a dark cloud, and enlightening the night, so that they could not come at one another all the night. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.21"><v id="21"></v>And when Moses had stretched forth his hand over the sea, the Lord took it away by a strong and burning wind blowing all the night, and turned it into dry ground: and the water was divided. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.22"><v id="22"></v>And the children of Israel went in through the midst of the sea dried up: for the water was as a wall on their right hand and on their left. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.23"><v id="23"></v>And the Egyptians pursuing went in after them, and all Pharao's horses, his chariots and horsemen through the midst of the sea, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.24"><v id="24"></v>And now the morning watch was come, and behold the Lord looking upon the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, slew their host. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.25"><v id="25"></v>And overthrew the wheels of the chariots, and they were carried into the deep. And the Egyptians said: Let us flee from Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.26"><v id="26"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth they hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and horsemen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.27"><v id="27"></v>And when Moses had stretched forth his hand towards the sea, it returned at the first break of day to the former place: and as the Egyptians were fleeing away, the waters came upon them, and the Lord shut them up in the middle of the waves. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.28"><v id="28"></v>And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the army of Pharao, who had come into the sea after them, neither did there so much as one of them remain. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.29"><v id="29"></v>But the children of Israel marched through the midst of the sea upon dry land, and the waters were to them as a wall on the right hand and on the left: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.30"><v id="30"></v>And the Lord delivered Israel on that day out of the hands of the Egyptians. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.14.31"><v id="31"></v>And they saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore, and the mighty hand that the Lord had used against them: and the people feared the Lord, and they believed the Lord, and Moses his servant. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.2"><v id="2"></v>And all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. </bcv></p0>

Why have you brought us into this desert, that you might destroy all the multitude with famine? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.4"><v id="4"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you: let the people go forth, and gather what is sufficient for every day: that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law, or not. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.7"><v id="7"></v>And in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord: for he hath heard your murmuring against the Lord: but as for us, what are we, that you mutter against us? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.8"><v id="8"></v>And Moses said: In the evening the Lord will give you flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full: for he hath heard your murmurings, with which you have murmured against him, for what are we? your murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.9"><v id="9"></v>Moses also said to Aaron: Say to the whole congregation of the children of Israel: Come before the Lord: for he hath heard your murmuring. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.13"><v id="13"></v>So it came to pass in the evening, that quails coming up, covered the camp: and in the morning, a dew lay round about the camp. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.15"><v id="15"></v>And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another: Manhu! which signifieth: What is this! for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them: This is the bread, which the Lord hath given you to eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.16"><v id="16"></v>This is the word, that the Lord hath commanded: Let every one gather of it as much as is enough to eat: a gomor for every man, according to the number of your souls that dwell in a tent, so shall you take of it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.17"><v id="17"></v>And the children of Israel did so: and they gathered, one more, another less. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.18"><v id="18"></v>And they measured by the measure of a gomor: neither had he more that had gathered more: nor did he find less that had provided less: but every one had gathered, according to what they were able to eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.19"><v id="19"></v>And Moses said to them: Let no man leave thereof till the morning. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.20"><v id="20"></v>And they hearkened not to him, but some of them left until the morning, and it began to be full of worms, an it putrefied, and Moses was angry with them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.21"><v id="21"></v>Now every one of them gathered in the morning, as much as might suffice to eat: and after the sun grew hot, it melted. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.24"><v id="24"></v>And they did so as Moses had commanded, and it did not putrefy, neither was there worm found in it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.25"><v id="25"></v>And Moses said: Eat it to day, because it is the sabbath of the Lord: to day it shall not be found in the field. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.26"><v id="26"></v>Gather it six days: but on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord, therefore it shall not be found. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.27"><v id="27"></v>And the seventh day came: and some of the people going forth to gather, found none. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.28"><v id="28"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: How long will you refuse to keep my commandments, and my law? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.29"><v id="29"></v>See that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, and for this reason on the sixth day he giveth you a double provision: let each man stay at home, and let none go forth out of his place the seventh day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.30"><v id="30"></v>And the people kept the sabbath on the seventh day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.31"><v id="31"></v>And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed white, and the taste thereof like to flour with honey. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.32"><v id="32"></v>And Moses said: This is the word, which the Lord hath commanded: Fill a gomor of it, and let it be kept unto generations to come hereafter, that they may know the bread, wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when you were brought forth out of the land of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.16.33"><v id="33"></v>And Moses said to Aaron: Take a vessel, and put manna into it, as much as a gomor can hold: and lay it up before the Lord to keep unto your generations, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.19.3"><v id="3"></v>And Moses went up to God: and the Lord called unto him from the mountain, and said: Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.19.4"><v id="4"></v>You have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, how I have carried you upon the wings of eagles, and have taken you to myself. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.19.9"><v id="9"></v>The Lord said to him: Lo, now will I come to thee in the darkness of a cloud, that the people may hear me speaking to thee, and may believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.19.10"><v id="10"></v>And he said to him: Go to the people, and sanctify them to day, and to morrow, and let them wash their garments. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.19.11"><v id="11"></v>And let them be ready against the third day: for on the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.19.20"><v id="20"></v>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, in the very top of the mount, and he called Moses unto the top thereof. And when he was gone up thither, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.19.21"><v id="21"></v>He said unto him: Go down, and charge the people: lest they should have a mind to pass the limits to see the Lord, and a very great multitude of them should perish. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.19.24"><v id="24"></v>And the Lord said to him: Go, get thee down: and thou shalt come up, thou and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people pass the limits, nor come up to the Lord, lest he kill them. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.30.11"><v id="11"></v>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.30.14"><v id="14"></v>He that is counted in the number from twenty years and upwards, shall give the price. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.30.15"><v id="15"></v>The rich man shall not add to half a sicle, and the poor man shall diminish nothing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.30.16"><v id="16"></v>And the money received which was contributed by the children of Israel, thou shalt deliver unto the uses of the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be a memorial of them before the Lord, and he may be merciful to their souls. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.30.17"><v id="17"></v>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.30.30"><v id="30"></v>Thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and shalt sanctify them, that they may do the office of priesthood unto me. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.2"><v id="2"></v>And Aaron said to them: Take the golden earrings from the ears of your wives, and your sons and daughters, and bring them to me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.3"><v id="3"></v>And the people did what he had commanded, bringing the earrings to Aaron. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.4"><v id="4"></v>And when he had received them, he fashioned them by founders' work, and made of them a molten calf. And they said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.5"><v id="5"></v>And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it, and made proclamation by a crier's voice, saying: To morrow is the solemnity of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.6"><v id="6"></v>And rising in the morning, they offered holocausts, and peace victims, and the people sat down to eat, and drink, and they rose up to play. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.8"><v id="8"></v>They have quickly strayed from the way which thou didst shew them: and they have made to themselves a molten calf, and have adored it, and sacrificing victims to it, have said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.9"><v id="9"></v>And again the Lord said to Moses: See that this people is stiffnecked: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.12"><v id="12"></v>Let not the Egyptians say, I beseech thee: He craftily brought them out, that he might kill them in the mountains, and destroy them from the earth: let thy anger cease, and be appeased upon the wickedness of thy people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.13"><v id="13"></v>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thy own self, saying: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven: and this whole land that I have spoken of, I will give to you seed, and you shall possess it for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.14"><v id="14"></v>And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had spoken against his people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.15"><v id="15"></v>And Moses returned from the mount, carrying the two tables of the testimony in his hand, written on both sides, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.16"><v id="16"></v>And made by the work of God: the writing also of God was graven in the tables. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.17"><v id="17"></v>And Josue hearing the noise of the people shouting, said to Moses: The noise of battle is heard in the camp. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.18"><v id="18"></v>But he answered: It is not the cry of men encouraging to fight, nor the shout of men compelling to flee: but I hear the voice of singers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.19"><v id="19"></v>And when he came nigh to the camp, he saw the calf, and the dances: and being very angry, he threw the tables out of his hand, and broke them at the foot of the mount: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.20"><v id="20"></v>And laying hold of the calf which they had made, he burnt it, and beat it to powder, which he strowed into water, and gave thereof to the children of Israel to drink. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.21"><v id="21"></v>And he said to Aaron: What has this people done to thee, that thou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous sin? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.22"><v id="22"></v>And he answered him: Let not my lord be offended: for thou knowest this people, that they are prone to evil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.23"><v id="23"></v>They said to me: Make us gods, that may go before us: for as to this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is befallen him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.24"><v id="24"></v>And I said to them: Which of you hath any gold? and they took and brought it to me: and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.25"><v id="25"></v>And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had stripped them by occasion of the shame of the filth, and had set them naked among their enemies,) </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.26"><v id="26"></v>Then standing in the gate of the camp, he said: If any man be on the Lord's side let him join with me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.27"><v id="27"></v>And he said to them: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Put every man his sword upon his thigh: go, and return from gate to gate through the midst of the camp, and let every man kill his brother, and friend, and neighbour. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.28"><v id="28"></v>And the sons of Levi did according to the words of Moses, and there were slain that day about three and twenty thousand men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.29"><v id="29"></v>And Moses said: You have consecrated your hands this day to the Lord, every man in his son and in his brother, that a blessing may be given to you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.30"><v id="30"></v>And when the next day was come, Moses spoke to the people: You have sinned a very great sin: I will go up to the Lord, if by any means I may be able to entreat him for your crime. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.31"><v id="31"></v>And returning to the Lord, he said: I beseech thee: this people hath sinned a heinous sin, and they have made to themselves gods of gold: either forgive them this trespass, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.32"><v id="32"></v>Or if thou do not, strike me out of the book that thou hast written. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.33"><v id="33"></v>And the Lord answered him: He that hath sinned against me, him will I strike out of my book: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.32.34"><v id="34"></v>But go thou, and lead this people whither I have told thee: my angel shall go before thee. And I in the day of revenge will visit this sin also of theirs. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.2"><v id="2"></v>And I will send an angel before thee, that I may cast out the Chanaanite, and the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.3"><v id="3"></v>That thou mayst enter into the land that floweth with milk and honey. For I will not go up with thee, because thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I destroy thee in the way. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.4"><v id="4"></v>And the people hearing these very bad tidings, mourned: and no man put on his ornaments according to custom. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.6"><v id="6"></v>So the children of Israel laid aside their ornaments by mount Horeb. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.9"><v id="9"></v>And when he was gone into the tabernacle of the covenant, the pillar of the cloud came down, and stood at the door, and he spoke with Moses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.10"><v id="10"></v>And all saw that the pillar of the cloud stood at the door of the tabernacle. And they stood, and worshipped at the doors of their tents. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.11"><v id="11"></v>And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man is wont to speak to his friend. And when he returned into the camp, his servant Josue the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from the tabernacle. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.12"><v id="12"></v>And Moses said to the Lord; Thou commandest me to lead forth this people: and thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me, especially whereas thou hast said: I know thee by name, and thou hast found favour in my sight. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.13"><v id="13"></v>If therefore I have found favour in thy sight, show me thy face, that I may know thee, and may find grace before thy eyes: look upon thy people this nation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.14"><v id="14"></v>And the Lord said: My face shall go before thee, and I will give thee rest. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.15"><v id="15"></v>And Moses said: If thou thyself dost not go before, bring us not out of this place. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="2.33.17"><v id="17"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: This word also, which thou hast spoken, will I do: for thou hast found grace before me, and thee I have known by name. </bcv></p0>
