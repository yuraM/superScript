<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.1"><v id="1"></v>And Moab rebelled against Israel, after the death of Achab. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.2"><v id="2"></v>And Ochozias fell through the lattices of his upper chamber which he had in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, saying to them: Go, consult Beelzebub, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my illness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.3"><v id="3"></v>And an angel of the Lord spoke to Elias the Thesbite, saying: Arise, and go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them: Is there not a God in Israel, that ye go to consult Beelzebub the god of Accaron? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.4"><v id="4"></v>Wherefore thus saith the Lord: From the bed, on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die. And Elias went away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.5"><v id="5"></v>And the messengers turned back to Ochozias. And he said to them: Why are you come back? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.6"><v id="6"></v>But they answered him: A man met us, and said to us: Go, and return to the king, that sent you, and you shall say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Is it because there was no God in Israel that thou sendest to Beelzebub the god of Accaron? Therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed, on which thou art gone up, but then shalt surely die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.7"><v id="7"></v>And he said to them: What manner of man was he who met you, and spoke these words? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.8"><v id="8"></v>But they said: A hairy man with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said: It is Elias the Thesbite. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.9"><v id="9"></v>And he sent to him a captain of fifty, and the fifty men that were under him. And he went up to him, and as he was sitting on the top of a hill, said to him: Man of God, the king hath commanded that thou come down. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.10"><v id="10"></v>And Elias answering, said to the captain of fifty: If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee, and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him, and the fifty that were with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.11"><v id="11"></v>And again he sent to him another captain of fifty men, and his fifty with him. And he said to him: Man of God, thus saith the king: Make haste and come down. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.12"><v id="12"></v>Elias answering, said: If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.13"><v id="13"></v>Again he sent a third captain of fifty men, and the fifty that were with him. And when he was come, he fell upon his knees, before Elias, and besought him and said: Man of God, despise not my life, and the lives of thy servants that are with me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.14"><v id="14"></v>Behold fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two first captains of fifty men, and the fifties that were with them: but now I beseech thee to spare my life. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.15"><v id="15"></v>And the angel of the Lord spoke to Elias, saying: Go down with him, fear not. He arose therefore, and went down with him to the king, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.16"><v id="16"></v>And said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Because thou hast sent messengers to consult Beelzebub the god of Accaron, as though there were not a God in Israel, of whom thou mightest inquire the word; therefore from the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.17"><v id="17"></v>So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elias spoke, and Joram his brother reigned in his stead, in the second year of Joram the son of Josaphat king of Juda: because he had no son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.1.18"><v id="18"></v>But the rest of the acts of Ochozias which he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.1"><v id="1"></v>And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elias into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elias and Eliseus were going from Galgal. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.2"><v id="2"></v>And Elias said to Eliseus: Stay thou here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as Bethel. And Eliseus said to him: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And when they were come down to Bethel, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.3"><v id="3"></v>The sons of the prophets, that were at Bethel, came forth to Eliseus, and said to him: Dost thou know that this day the Lord will take away thy master from thee? And he answered: I also know it: hold your peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.4"><v id="4"></v>And Elias said to Eliseus: Stay here because the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And when they were come to Jericho, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.5"><v id="5"></v>The sons of the prophets that were at Jericho, came to Eliseus, and said to him: Dost thou know that this day the Lord will take away thy master from thee? And he said: I also know it: hold your peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.6"><v id="6"></v>And Elias said to him: Stay here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as the Jordan. And he said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee; and they two went on together, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.7"><v id="7"></v>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets followed them, and stood in sight at a distance: but they two stood by the Jordan. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.8"><v id="8"></v>And Elias took his mantle and folded it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, and they both passed over on dry ground. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.9"><v id="9"></v>And when they were gone over, Elias said to Eliseus: Ask what thou wilt have me to do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Eliseus said: I beseech thee that in me may be thy double spirit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.10"><v id="10"></v>And he answered: Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee, thou shalt have what thou hast asked: but if thou see me not, thou shalt not have it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.11"><v id="11"></v>And as they went on, walking and talking together, behold a fiery chariot, and fiery horses parted them both asunder: and Elias went up by a whirlwind into heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.12"><v id="12"></v>And Eliseus saw him, and cried: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the driver thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own garments, and rent them in two pieces. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.13"><v id="13"></v>And he took up the mantle of Elias, that fell from him: and going back, he stood upon the bank of the Jordan, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.14"><v id="14"></v>And he struck the waters with the mantle of Elias, that had fallen from him, and they were not divided. And he said: Where is now the God of Elias? And he struck the waters, and they were divided, hither and thither, and Eliseus passed over. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.15"><v id="15"></v>And the sons of the prophets at Jericho, who were over against him, seeing it said: The spirit of Elias hath rested upon Eliseus. And coming to meet him, they worshipped him, falling to the ground, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.16"><v id="16"></v>And they said to him: Behold, there are with thy servants fifty strong men, that can go, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the spirit of the Lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. And he said: Do not send. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.17"><v id="17"></v>But they pressed him, till he consented, and said: Send. And they sent fifty men: and they sought three days but found him not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.18"><v id="18"></v>And they came back to him: for he abode at Jericho, and he said to them: Did I not say to you: Do not send? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.19"><v id="19"></v>And the men of the city said to Eliseus: Behold the situation of this city is very good, as thou, my lord, seest: but the waters are very bad, and the ground barren. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.20"><v id="20"></v>And he said: Bring me a new vessel, and put salt into it. And when they had brought it, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.21"><v id="21"></v>He went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt into it, and said: Thus saith the Lord: I have healed these waters, and there shall be no more in them death or barrenness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.22"><v id="22"></v>And the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Eliseus, which he spoke. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.23"><v id="23"></v>And he went up from thence to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, little boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying: Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.24"><v id="24"></v>And looking back, he saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord: and there came forth two bears out of the forest, and tore of them two and forty boys. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.2.25"><v id="25"></v>And from thence he went to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.1"><v id="1"></v>And Joram the son of Achab reigned over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of m Josaphat king of Juda. And he reigned twelve years. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.2"><v id="2"></v>And he did evil before the Lord, but not like his father and his mother: for he took away the statues of Baal, which his father had made. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.3"><v id="3"></v>Nevertheless he stuck to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, nor did he depart from them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.4"><v id="4"></v>Now Mesa, king of Moab, nourished many sheep, and he paid to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams with their fleeces. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.5"><v id="5"></v>And when Achab was dead, he broke the league which he had made with the king of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.6"><v id="6"></v>And king Joram went out that day from Samaria, and mustered all Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.7"><v id="7"></v>And he sent to Josaphat king of Juda, saying: The king of Moab is revolted from me, come with me against him to battle. And he answered: I will come up: he that is mine, is thine: my people, thy people: and my horses, thy horses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.8"><v id="8"></v>And he said: Which way shall we go up? But he answered: By the desert of Edom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.9"><v id="9"></v>So the king of Israel, and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom went, and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey, and there was no water for the army, and for the beasts, that followed them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.10"><v id="10"></v>And the king of Israel said: Alas, alas, alas, the Lord hath gathered us three kings together, to deliver us into the hands of Moab! </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.11"><v id="11"></v>And Josaphat said: Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may beseech the Lord by him? And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered: Here is Eliseus the son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of Elias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.12"><v id="12"></v>And Josaphat said: The word of the Lord is with him. And the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, and the king of Edom went down to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.13"><v id="13"></v>And Eliseus said to the king of Israel: What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him: Why hath the Lord gathered together these three kings, to deliver them into the hands of Moab? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.14"><v id="14"></v>And Eliseus said to him: As the Lord of hosts liveth, in whose sight I stand, if I did not reverence the face of Josaphat king of Juda, I would not have hearkened to thee, nor looked on thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.15"><v id="15"></v>But now bring me hither a minstrel. And when the minstrel played, the hand of the Lord came upon him, and he said: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.16"><v id="16"></v>Thus saith the Lord: Make the channel of this torrent full of ditches. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.17"><v id="17"></v>For thus saith the Lord: You shall not see wind, nor rain: and yet this channel shall be filled with waters, and you shall drink, you and your families, and your beasts. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.18"><v id="18"></v>And this is a small thing in the sight of the Lord: moreover he will deliver also Moab into your hands. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.19"><v id="19"></v>And you shall destroy every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall cut down every fruitful tree, and shall stop up all the springs of waters, and every goodly field you shall cover with stones. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.20"><v id="20"></v>And it came to pass in the morning, when the sacrifices used to be offered, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.21"><v id="21"></v>And all the Moabites hearing that the kings were come up to fight against them, gathered together all that were girded with a belt upon them, and stood in the borders. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.22"><v id="22"></v>And they rose early in the morning, and the sun being now up, and shining upon the waters, the Moabites saw the waters over against them red, like blood, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.23"><v id="23"></v>And they said: It is the blood of the sword: the kings have fought among themselves, and they have killed one another: go now, Moab, to the spoils. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.24"><v id="24"></v>And they went into the camp of Israel: but Israel rising up defeated Moab, who fled before them. And they being conquerors, went and smote Moab. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.25"><v id="25"></v>And they destroyed the cities: and they filled every goodly field, every man casting his stone: and they stopt up all the springs of waters: and cut down all the trees that bore fruit, so that brick walls only remained: and the city was beset by the slingers, and a great part thereof destroyed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.26"><v id="26"></v>And when the king of Moab saw this, to wit, that the enemies had prevailed, he took with him seven hundred men that drew the sword, to break in upon the king of Edom: but they could not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.3.27"><v id="27"></v>Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall: and there was great indignation in Israel, and presently they departed from him, and returned into their own country. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.1"><v id="1"></v>Now a certain woman of the wives of the prophets cried to Eliseus, saying: Thy servant my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant was one that feared God, and behold the creditor is come to take away my two sons to serve him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.2"><v id="2"></v>And Eliseus said to her: What wilt thou have me to do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in thy house? And she answered: I thy handmaid have nothing in my house but a little oil, to anoint me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.3"><v id="3"></v>And he said to her: Go, borrow of all thy neighbours empty vessels not a few. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.4"><v id="4"></v>And go in, and shut thy door, when thou art within, and thy sons: and pour out thereof into all those vessels: and when they are full take them away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.5"><v id="5"></v>So the woman went, and shut the door upon her, and upon her sons: they brought her the vessels, and she poured in. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.6"><v id="6"></v>And when the vessels were full, she said to her son: Bring me yet a vessel. And he answered: I have no more. And the oil stood. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.7"><v id="7"></v>And she came, and told the man of God. And he said: Go, sell the oil, and pay thy creditor: and thou and thy sons live of the rest. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.8"><v id="8"></v>And there was a day when Eliseus passed by Sunam: now there was a great woman there, who detained him to eat bread; and as he passed often that way, he turned into her house to eat bread. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.9"><v id="9"></v>And she said to her husband: I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who often passeth by us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.10"><v id="10"></v>Let us therefore make him a little chamber, and put a little bed in it for him, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick, that when he cometh to us, he may abide there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.11"><v id="11"></v>Now there was a certain day when he came and turned in to the chamber, and rested there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.12"><v id="12"></v>And he said to Giezi his servant Call this Sunamitess. And when he had called her, and she stood before him, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.13"><v id="13"></v>He said to his servant: Say to her Behold thou hast diligently served us in all things, what wilt thou have me to de for thee? hast thou any business, and wilt thou that I speak to the king, or to the general of the army? And she answered: I dwell in the midst of my own people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.14"><v id="14"></v>And he said : What will she then that I do for her? And Giezi said: Do not ask, for she hath no son, and her husband is old. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.15"><v id="15"></v>Then he bid him call her: And when she was called, and stood before the door. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.16"><v id="16"></v>He said to her: At this time, and this same hour, if life accompany, thou shalt have a son in thy womb. But she answered: Do not, I beseech thee, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.17"><v id="17"></v>And the woman conceived, and brought forth a son in the time, and at the same hour, that Eliseus had said. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.18"><v id="18"></v>And the child grew. And on a certain day, when he went out to his father to the reapers, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.19"><v id="19"></v>He said to his father: My head acheth, my head acheth. But he said to his servant: Take him, and carry him to his mother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.20"><v id="20"></v>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, she set him on her knees until noon, and then he died. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.21"><v id="21"></v>And she went up and laid him upon the bed of the man of God, and shut the door: and going out, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.22"><v id="22"></v>She called her husband, and said: Send with me, I beseech thee, one of thy servants, and an ass that I may run to the man of God, and come again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.23"><v id="23"></v>And he said to her: Why dost thou go to him? to day is neither new moon nor sabbath. She answered: I will go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.24"><v id="24"></v>And she saddled an ass, and commanded her servant: Drive, and make haste, make no stay in going. And do that which I bid thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.25"><v id="25"></v>So she went forward, and came to the man of God to mount Carmel: and when the mall of God saw her coming towards, he said to Giezi his servant : Behold that Sunamitess. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.26"><v id="26"></v>Go therefore to meet her, and say to her: Is all well with thee, and with thy husband, and with thy son? and she answered: Well. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.27"><v id="27"></v>And when she came to the man of God to the mount, she caught hold on his feet: and Giezi came to remove her. And the man of God said: Let her alone for her soul is in anguish, and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.28"><v id="28"></v>And she said to him: Did I ask a son of my lord? did I not say to thee: Do not deceive me? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.29"><v id="29"></v>Then he said to Giezi: Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go. If any man meet thee, salute him not: and if any man salute thee, answer him not: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.30"><v id="30"></v>But the mother of the child said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. He arose, therefore, and followed her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.31"><v id="31"></v>But Giezi was gone before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child, and there was no voice nor sense: and he returned to meet him, and told him, saying: The child is not risen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.32"><v id="32"></v>Eliseus therefore went into the house, and behold the child lay dead on his bed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.33"><v id="33"></v>And going in he shut the door upon him, and upon the child, and prayed to the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.34"><v id="34"></v>And he went up, and lay upon the child: and he put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he bowed himself upon him, and the child's flesh grew warm. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.35"><v id="35"></v>Then he returned and walked in the house, once to and fro: and he went up, and lay upon him: and the child gaped seven times, and opened his eyes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.36"><v id="36"></v>And he called Giezi, and said to him: Call this Sunamitess. And she being called, went in to him: and he said: Take up thy son. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.38"><v id="38"></v>And Eliseus returned to Galgal, and there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets dwelt before him. And he said to one of his servants: Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.39"><v id="39"></v>And one went out into the field to gather wild herbs: and he found something like a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds of the field, and filled his mantle, and coming back he shred them into the pot of pottage, for he knew not what it was. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.40"><v id="40"></v>And they poured it out for their companions to eat: and when they had tasted of the pottage, they cried out, saying: Death is in the pot, O man of God. And they could not eat thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.41"><v id="41"></v>But he said: Bring some meal. And when they had brought it, he cast it into the pot, and said: Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was now no bitterness in the pot. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.42"><v id="42"></v>And a certain man came from Baalsalisa bringing to the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty leaves of barley, and new corn in his scrip. And he said: Give to the people, that they may eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.43"><v id="43"></v>And his servant answered him: How much is this, that I should set it before a hundred men? He said again: Give to the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the Lord: They shall eat, and there shall be left. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.4.44"><v id="44"></v>So he fief it before them: and they ate, and there was left according to the word of the Lord. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.1"><v id="1"></v>Naaman, general of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable: for by him the Lord gave deliverance to Syria: and he was a valiant man and rich, but a leper. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.2"><v id="2"></v>Now there had gone out robbers from Syria, and had led away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid, and she waited upon Naaman's wife. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.3"><v id="3"></v>And she said to her mistress: I wish my master had been with the prophet, that is in Samaria: he would certainly have healed him of the leprosy which he hath. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.4"><v id="4"></v>Then Naaman went in to his lord, and told him, saying: Thus and thus said tile girl from the land of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.5"><v id="5"></v>And the king of Syria sad to him: Go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and tell changes of raiment, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.6"><v id="6"></v>And brought the letter to the king of Israel, in these words: When thou shalt receive this letter, know that I have sent to thee Naaman my servant, that thou mayest heal him of his leprosy. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.7"><v id="7"></v>And when the king of Israel had read the letter, he rent his garments, and said: Am I God, to be able to kill and give life, that this man hath sent to me, to heal a man of his leprosy? mark, and see how he seeketh occasions against me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.8"><v id="8"></v>And when Eliseus the man of God had heard this, to wit, that the king of Israel had rent his garments, he sent to him, saying: Why hast thou rent thy garments? let him come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.9"><v id="9"></v>So Naaman came with Iris horses and chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Eliseus: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.10"><v id="10"></v>And Eliseus sent a messenger to him, saying: Go, and wash seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall recover health, and thee shalt be clean. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.11"><v id="11"></v>Naaman was angry and went away, saying: I thought he would hare come out to me, and standing would hare invoked the name of the Lord his God, and touched with his hand the place of the leprosy, and healed me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.12"><v id="12"></v>Are not the Abana, and the Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, that I may wash in them, and be made clean? So as he turned, and was going away with indignation, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.13"><v id="13"></v>His servants came to him, and said to him: Father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, surely thou shouldst have done it: how much rather what he now hath said to thee: Wash, and thou shalt he clean? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.14"><v id="14"></v>Then he went down, and washed in the Jordan seven times: according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored, like the flesh of a little child, and he was made clean. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.15"><v id="15"></v>And returning to the man of God with all his train, be came, and stood before him, and said: In truth, I know there is no other God in all the earth, but only in Israel: I beseech thee therefore take a blessing of thy servant. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.16"><v id="16"></v>But he answered: As the Lord liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And when he pressed him, he still refused. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.17"><v id="17"></v>And Naaman said: As thou wilt: but I beseech thee, grant to me thy servant, to take from hence two mules' burden of earth: for thy servant will not henceforth offer holocaust, or victim, to other gods, but to the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.18"><v id="18"></v>But there is only this, for which thou shalt entreat the Lord for thy servant, when my master goeth into the temple of Remmon, to worship: and he leaneth upon my hand, if I bow down in the temple of Remmon, when he boweth down in the same place, that the Lord pardon me thy servant for this thing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.19"><v id="19"></v>And he said to him: Go in peace. So he departed from him in the springtime of the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.20"><v id="20"></v>But Giezi the servant of the man of God said: My master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving of him that which he brought: as the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take some thing of him: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.21"><v id="21"></v>21And Giezi followed after Naaman: and when he saw him running after him, he leapt down from his chariot to meet him, and said: Is all well? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.22"><v id="22"></v>And he said: Well: my master hath sent me to thee, saying: Just now there are come to me from mount Ephraim, two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.23"><v id="23"></v>And Naaman said: It is better that thou take two talents. And he forced him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants, and they carried them before him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.24"><v id="24"></v>And when he was come, and now it was the evening, he took them from their hands, and laid them up in the house, and sent the men away, and they departed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.25"><v id="25"></v>But he went in, and stood before his master. And Eliseus said: Whence comest thou, Giezi? He answered: Thy servant went no whither. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.26"><v id="26"></v>But he said: Was not my heart present, when the man turned back from his chariot to meet thee? So now thou hast received money, and received garments, to buy oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.5.27"><v id="27"></v>But the leprosy of Naaman shall also stick to thee, and to thy seed for ever. And he went out from him a leper as white as snow. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.1"><v id="1"></v>And the sons of the prophets said to Eliseus: Behold the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.2"><v id="2"></v>Let us go as far as the Jordan and take out of the wood every man a piece of timber, that we may build us there a place to dwell in. And he said: Go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.3"><v id="3"></v>And one of them said: But come thou also with thy servants. He answered: I will come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.4"><v id="4"></v>So he went with them. And when they were come to the Jordan they cut down wood. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.5"><v id="5"></v>And it happened, as one was felling some timber, that the head of the axe fell into the water: and he cried out, and said: Alas, alas, alas, my lord, for this same was borrowed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.6"><v id="6"></v>And the man of God said: Where did it fall? and he shewed him the place. Then he cut off a piece of wood, and cast it in thither: and the iron swam. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.7"><v id="7"></v>And he said: Take it up. And he put out his hand and took it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.8"><v id="8"></v>And the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying: In such and such a place let us lay ambushes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.9"><v id="9"></v>And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying: Beware that thou pass not to such a place: for the Syrians are there in ambush. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.10"><v id="10"></v>And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God had told him, and prevented him, and looked well to himself there not once nor twice. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.11"><v id="11"></v>And the heart of the king of Syria was troubled for this thing. And calling together his servants, he said: Why do you not tell me who it is that betrays me to the king of Israel? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.12"><v id="12"></v>And one of his servants said: No one, my lord O king: but Eliseus the prophet, that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel all the words, that thou speakest in thy privy chamber. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.13"><v id="13"></v>And he said to them: Go, and see where he is: that I may send, and take him. And they told him, saying: Behold he is in Dothan. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.14"><v id="14"></v>Therefore he sent thither horses and chariots, and the strength of an army: and they came by night, and beset the city. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.15"><v id="15"></v>And the servant of the man of God rising early, went out, and saw an army round about the city, and horses and chariots: and he told him, saying: Alas, alas, alas, my lord, what shall we do? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.16"><v id="16"></v>But he answered: Fear not: for there are more with us than with them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.17"><v id="17"></v>And Eliseus prayed, and said: Lord, open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw: and behold the mountain was full of horses, and chariots of fire round about Eliseus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.18"><v id="18"></v>And the enemies came down to him, but Eliseus prayed to the Lord, saying: Strike, I beseech thee, this people with blindness. And the Lord struck them with blindness, according to the word of Eliseus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.19"><v id="19"></v>And Eliseus said to them: This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will shew you the man whom you seek. So he led them into Samaria. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.20"><v id="20"></v>And when they were come into Samaria, Eliseus said: Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw themselves to be in the midst of Samaria. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.21"><v id="21"></v>And the king of Israel said to Eliseus, when he saw them: My father, shall I kill them? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.23"><v id="23"></v>And a great provision of meats was set before them, and they ate and drank, and he let them go, and they went away to their master, and the robbers of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.24"><v id="24"></v>And tit came to pass after these things, that Benadad king of Syria gathered together all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.25"><v id="25"></v>And there was a great famine in Samaria: and so long did the siege continue, till the head of an ass was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cabe of pigeon's dung, for five pieces of silver. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.26"><v id="26"></v>And as the king of Israel was passing by the wall, a certain woman cried out to him, saying: Save me, my lord O king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.27"><v id="27"></v>And he said: If the Lord doth not save thee, how can I save thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress? And the king said to her: What aileth thee? And she answered: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.28"><v id="28"></v>This woman said to me: Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.29"><v id="29"></v>So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day: Give thy son that we may eat him. And she hath hid her son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.30"><v id="30"></v>When the king heard this, he rent his garments, and passed by upon the wall. And all the people saw the haircloth which he wore within next to his flesh. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.31"><v id="31"></v>And the king said: May God do so and so to me, and may he add more, if the head of Eliseus the son of Saphat shall stand on him this day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.32"><v id="32"></v>But Eliseus sat in his house, and the ancients sat with him. So he sent a man before: and before that messenger came, he said to the ancients: Do you know that this son of a murderer hath sent to cut off my head? Look then, when the messenger shall come, shut the door, and suffer him not to come in: for behold the sound of his master's feet is behind him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.6.33"><v id="33"></v>While he was yet speaking to them, the messenger appeared who was coming to him. And he said: Behold, so great an evil is from the Lord: what shall I look for more from the Lord? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.1"><v id="1"></v>And Eliseus said: Hear ye the word of the Lord: Thus saith the Lord: To morrow about this time a bushel of fine hour shall be sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, in the gate of Samaria. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.2"><v id="2"></v>Then one of the lords, upon whose hand the king leaned, answering the man of God, said: If the Lord should make hood-gates in heaven, can that possibly be which thou sayest? And he said: Thou shalt see it with thy eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.3"><v id="3"></v>Now there were four lepers, at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another: What mean we to stay here till we die? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.4"><v id="4"></v>If we will enter into the city, we shall die with the famine: and if we will remain here, we must also die: come, therefore, and let us run over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare us, we shall live: but if they kill us, we shall but die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.5"><v id="5"></v>So they arose in the evening, to go to the Syrian camp, And when they were come to the first part of the camp of the Syrians, they found no man there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.6"><v id="6"></v>For the Lord had made them hear, in the camp of Syria, the noise of chariots, and of horses, and of a very great army, and they said one to another: Behold the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hethites, and of the Egyptians, and they are come upon us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.7"><v id="7"></v>Wherefore they arose, and fled away in the dark, and left their tents, and their horses and asses in the camp, and fled, desiring to save their lives. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.8"><v id="8"></v>So when these lepers were come to the beginning of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank: and they took from thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went, and hid it: and they came again, and went into another tent, and carried from thence in like manner, and hid it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.9"><v id="9"></v>Then they said one to another: We do not well: for this is a day of good tidings. If we hold our peace, and do not tell it till the morning, we shall be charged with a crime: come, let us go and tell it in the king's court. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.10"><v id="10"></v>So they came to the gate of the city, and told them, saying: We went to the camp of the Syrians, and we found no man there, but horses, and asses tied, and the tents standing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.11"><v id="11"></v>Then the guards of the gate went, and told it within the king's palace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.12"><v id="12"></v>And he arose in the night and said to his servants: I tell you what the Syrians have done to us: They know that we suffer great famine, and therefore they are gone out of the camp, and lie hid in the fields, saying: When they come out of the city we shall take them alive, and then we may get into the city. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.13"><v id="13"></v>And one of his servants answered: Let us take the five horses that are remaining in the city (because there are no more in the whole multitude of Israel, for the rest are consumed,) and let us send and see. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.14"><v id="14"></v>They brought therefore two horses, and the king sent into the camp of the Syrians, saying: Go, and see. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.15"><v id="15"></v>And they went after them as far as the Jordan: and behold all the way was full of garments, and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their fright, and the messengers returned end told the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.16"><v id="16"></v>And the people going out pillaged the camp of the Syrians: and a bushel of fine flour was sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, according to the word of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.17"><v id="17"></v>And the king appointed that lord on whose hand he leaned, to stand at the gate: and the people trod upon him in the entrance of the gate; and he died, as the man of God had said, when the king came down to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.7.18"><v id="18"></v>And it came to pass according to the word of the man of God, which he spoke to the king, when he said: Two bushels of barley shall be for a stater, and a bushel of fine flour for a stater, at this very time to morrow in the gate of Samaria. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.18"><v id="18"></v>And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Achab had walked: for the daughter of Achab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.19"><v id="19"></v>But the Lord would not destroy Juda, for David his servant's sake, as he had promised him, to give him a light, and to his children always. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.20"><v id="20"></v>In his days Edom revolted, from being under Juda, and made themselves a king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.21"><v id="21"></v>And Joram came to Seira, and all the chariots with him: and he arose in the night, and defeated the Edomites that had surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots, but the people fled into their tents. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.22"><v id="22"></v>So Edom revolted from being under Juda, unto this day. Then Lobna also revolted at the same time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.23"><v id="23"></v>But the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.24"><v id="24"></v>And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, and Ochozias his son reigned in Iris stead. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.25"><v id="25"></v>In the twelfth year of Joram son of Achab king of Israel, reigned Ochozias son of Joram king of Juda. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.26"><v id="26"></v>Ochozias was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Athalia the daughter of Amri king of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.27"><v id="27"></v>And he walked in the ways of the house of Achab: and he did evil before the Lord, as did the house of Achab: for he was the son in law of the house of Achab. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.28"><v id="28"></v>He went also with Joram son of Achab, to fight against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth Galaad, and the Syrians wounded Joram: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.8.29"><v id="29"></v>And he went back to be healed, in Jezrahel: because the Syrians had wounded him in Ramoth when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ochozias the son of Joram king of Juda, went down to visit Joram the son of Achab in Jezrahel, because he was sick there. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.1"><v id="1"></v>And Eliseus the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, slid said to him: Gird up thy loins, and take this little bottle of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth Galaad. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.2"><v id="2"></v>And when thou art come thither, thou shalt see Jehu the son of Josaphat the son of Namsi: and going in thou shalt make him rise up from amongst his brethren, and carry him into an inner chamber. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.3"><v id="3"></v>Then taking the little bottle of oil, thou shalt pour it on his head, and shalt say: Thus saith the Lord: I have anointed thee king over Israel. And thou shalt open the door and flee, and shalt not stay there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.4"><v id="4"></v>So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went awry to Ramoth Galaad, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.5"><v id="5"></v>And went in thither: and behold the captains of the army were sitting: and he said: I have a word to thee, O prince. And Jehu said: Unto whom of us all? And he said: To thee, O prince. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.6"><v id="6"></v>And he arose, and went into the chamber: and he poured the oil upon his head, and said: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel : I have anointed thee king over Israel, the people of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.7"><v id="7"></v>And thou shalt cut off the house of Achab thy master, and I will revenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord at the hand of Jezabel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.8"><v id="8"></v>And I will destroy all the house of Achab, and I will cut off from Achab him that pisseth against the well, and him that is shut up, and the meanest in Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.9"><v id="9"></v>And I will make the house of Achab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and like the house of Baasa the son of Ahias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.10"><v id="10"></v>And the dogs shall eat Jezabel in the field of Jezrahel, and there shall be no one to bury her. And he opened the door and fled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.11"><v id="11"></v>Then Jehu went forth to the servants of his lord: and they said to him: Are all things well? why came this mad man to thee? And he said to them: You know the man, and what he said. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.12"><v id="12"></v>But they answered: It is false, but rather do thou tell us. And he said to them: Thus and thus did he speak to me: and he said: Thus saith the Lord: I have anointed thee king over Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.13"><v id="13"></v>Then they made haste and taking every man his garment laid it under his feet, after the manner of a judgment seat, and they sounded the trumpet, and said: Jehu is king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.14"><v id="14"></v>So Jehu the son of Josaphat the son of Namsi conspired against Joram. Now Joram had besieged Ramoth Galaad, he and all Israel fighting with Hazael king of Syria: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.15"><v id="15"></v>And was returned to be healed in Jezrahel of his wounds, for the Syrians had wounded him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Jehu said: If it please you, let no mall go forth or flee out of the city, lest he go, and tell in Jezrahel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.16"><v id="16"></v>And he got up, and went into Jezrahel: for Joram was sick there, and Ochozias king of Juda was come down to visit Joram. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.17"><v id="17"></v>The watchmen therefore, that stood upon the tower of Jezrahel, saw the troop of Jehu coming, and said: I see a troop. And Joram said: Take a chariot, and send to meet them, and let him that goeth say: Is all well? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.18"><v id="18"></v>So there went one in a chariot to meet him, and said : Thus saith the king: Are all things peaceable? And Jehu said: What hast thou to do with peace? go behind and follow me. And the watchman told, saying: The messenger came to them, but he returneth not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.19"><v id="19"></v>And he sent a second chariot of horses: and he came to them, and said: Thus saith the king: Is there peace? And Jehu said: What hast thou to do with peace? pass, and follow me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.20"><v id="20"></v>And the watchman told, saying: He came even to them, but returneth not: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Namsi, for he drives furiously. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.21"><v id="21"></v>And Joram said: Make ready the chariot. And they made ready his chariot, and Joram king of Israel, and Ochozias king of Juda went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him in the field of Naboth the Jezrahelite. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.22"><v id="22"></v>And when Joram saw Jehu, he said: Is there peace, Jehu? And he answered: What peace ? so long as the fornications of Jezabel thy mother, and her many sorceries are in their vigour. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.23"><v id="23"></v>And Joram turned his hand, and fleeing, said to Ochozias: There is treachery, Ochozias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.24"><v id="24"></v>But Jehu bent Iris bow with his hand, and shot Joram between the shoulders: and the arrow went out through his heart, and immediately he fell in his chariot. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.25"><v id="25"></v>And Jehu said to Badacer his captain: Take him, and cast him into the field of Naboth the Jezrahelite: for I remember when I and thou sitting in a chariot followed Achab this man's father, that the Lord laid this burden upon him, saying : </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.26"><v id="26"></v>If I do not requite thee in this field, saith the Lord, for the blood of Naboth, and for the blood of his children, which I saw yesterday, saith the Lord. So now take him, and cast him into the field, according to the word of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.27"><v id="27"></v>But Ochozias king of Juda seeing this, fled by the way of the garden house : and Jehu pursued him, and said: Strike him also in his chariot. And they struck him in the going up to Gaver, which is by Jeblaam: and he fled into Mageddo, and died there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.28"><v id="28"></v>And his servants laid him upon his chariot, and carried him to Jerusalem: and they buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.29"><v id="29"></v>In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Achab, Ochozias reigned over Juda, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.30"><v id="30"></v>And Jehu came into Jezrahel. But Jezabel hearing of his coming in, painted her face with stibic stone, and adorned her head, and looked out of a window </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.31"><v id="31"></v>At Jehu coming in at the gate, and said: Can there be peace for Zambri, that hath killed his master? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.32"><v id="32"></v>And Jehu lifted up his face to the window, and said : Who is this? And two or three eunuchs bowed down to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.33"><v id="33"></v>And he said to them: Throw her down headlong: and they threw her down, and the wall was sprinkled with her blood, and the hoofs of the horses trod upon her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.34"><v id="34"></v>And when he was come in, to eat, and to drink, he said: Go, and see after that cursed woman, and bury her: because she is a king's daughter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.35"><v id="35"></v>And when they went to bury her, they found nothing but the skull, and the feet, and the extremities of her hands. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.36"><v id="36"></v>And coming back they told him. And Jehu said: It is the word of the Lord, which he spoke by his servant Elias the Thesbite, saying: In the field of Jezrahel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezabel, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.9.37"><v id="37"></v>And the flesh of Jezabel shall be as dung upon the face of the earth in the field of Jezrahel, so that they who pass by shall say: Is this that same Jezabel? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.1"><v id="1"></v>And Achab had seventy sons in Samaria: so Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the chief men of the city, and to the ancients, and to them that brought up Achab's children, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.2"><v id="2"></v>As soon as you receive these letters, ye that have your master's sons, and chariots, and horses, and fenced cities, and armour, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.3"><v id="3"></v>Choose the best, and him that shall please you most of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for the house of your master. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.4"><v id="4"></v>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said: Behold two kings could not stand before him, and how shall we be able to resist? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.5"><v id="5"></v>Therefore the overseers of the house, and the rulers of the city, and the ancients, and the tutors sent to Jehu, saying: We are thy servants, whatsoever thou shalt command us we will do, neither will we make us a king: do thou all that pleaseth thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.6"><v id="6"></v>And he wrote letters the second time to them, saying: If you be mine, and will obey me, take the heads of the sons of your master, and come to me to Jezrahel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy men, were brought up with the chief men of the city. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.7"><v id="7"></v>And when the letters came to them, they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezrahel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.8"><v id="8"></v>And a messenger came, and told him, saying: They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said: Lay ye them in two heaps by the entering in of the gate until the morning. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.9"><v id="9"></v>And when it was light, he went out, and standing said to all the people: You are just: if I conspired against my master, and slew him, who hath slain all these? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.10"><v id="10"></v>See therefore now that there hath not fallen to the ground any of the words of the Lord, which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Achab, and the Lord hath done that which he spoke in the hand of his servant Elias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.11"><v id="11"></v>So Jehu slew all that were left of the house of Achab in Jezrahel, and all his chief men, and his friends, and his priests, till there were no remains left of him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.12"><v id="12"></v>And he arose, and went to Samaria: and when he was come to the shepherds' cabin in the way, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.13"><v id="13"></v>He met with the brethren of Ochozias king of Juda, and he said to them: Who are you? And they answered: We are the brethren of Ochozias, and are come down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.14"><v id="14"></v>And he said: Take them alive. And they took them alive, and killed them at the pit by the cabin, two and forty men, and he left not any of them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.15"><v id="15"></v>And when he was departed thence, he found Jonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him, and he blessed him. And he said to him: Is thy heart right as my heart is with thy heart? And Jonadab said: It is. If it be, said he, give me thy hand. He gave him his hand. And he lifted him up to him into the chariot, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.16"><v id="16"></v>And he said to him: Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord. So he made him ride in his chariot, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.17"><v id="17"></v>And brought him into Samaria. And he slew all that were left of Achab in Samaria, to a man, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by Elias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.18"><v id="18"></v>And Jehu gathered together all the people, and said to them: Achab worshipped Baal a little, but I will worship him more. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.19"><v id="19"></v>Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, and all his servants, and all his priests: let none be wanting, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal: whosoever shall be wanting shall not live. Now Jehu did this craftily, that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.20"><v id="20"></v>And he said: Proclaim a festival for Baal. And he called, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.21"><v id="21"></v>And he sent into all the borders of Israel, and all the servants of Baal came: there was not one left that did not come. And they went into the temple of Baal: and the house of Baal was filled, from one end to the other. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.22"><v id="22"></v>And he said to them that were over the wardrobe: Bring forth garments for all the servants of Baal. And they brought them forth garments. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.23"><v id="23"></v>And Jehu and Jonadab the son of Rechab went to the temple of Baal, and said to the worshippers of Baal: Search, and see that there be not any with you of the servants of the Lord, but that there be the servants of Baal only. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.24"><v id="24"></v>And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings: but Jehu had prepared him fourscore men without, and said to them: If any of the men escape, whom I have brought into your hands, he that letteth him go shall answer life for life. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.25"><v id="25"></v>And it came to pass, when the burnt offering was ended, that Jehu commanded his soldiers and captains, saying: Go in, and kill them, let none escape. And the soldiers and captains slew them with the edge of the sword, and cast them out: and they went into the city of the temple of Baal, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.26"><v id="26"></v>And brought the statue out of Baal's temple, and burnt it, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.27"><v id="27"></v>And broke it in pieces. They destroyed also the temple of Baal, and made a jakes in its place unto this day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.28"><v id="28"></v>So Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.29"><v id="29"></v>But yet he departed not from the sills of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, nor did he forsake the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.30"><v id="30"></v>And the Lord said to Jehu: Because thou hast diligently executed that which was right and pleasing in my eyes, and hast done to the house of Achab according to all that was in my heart: thy children shall sit upon the throne of Israel to the fourth Generation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.31"><v id="31"></v>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord the God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel to sin. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.32"><v id="32"></v>In those days the Lord began to he weary of Israel: and Hazael ravaged them in all the coasts of Israel, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.33"><v id="33"></v>From the Jordan eastward, all the land of Galaad, and Gad, and Ruben, and Manasses, from Aroer, which is upon the torrent Amen, and Galaad, and Basan. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.10.35"><v id="35"></v>And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria: and Joachaz his son reigned in his stead. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.1"><v id="1"></v>In the seventh year of Jehu Joas began to reign: and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Sebia of Bersabee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.2"><v id="2"></v>And Joas did that which was right before the Lord all the days that Joiada the priest taught him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.3"><v id="3"></v>But yet he took not away the high places: for the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.4"><v id="4"></v>And Joas said to the priests: All the money of the sanctified things, which is brought into the temple of the Lord by those that pass, which is offered for the price of a soul, and which of their own accord, and of their own free heart they bring into the temple of the Lord: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.5"><v id="5"></v>Let the priests take it according to their order, and repair the house, wheresoever they shall see any thing that wanteth repairing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.6"><v id="6"></v>Now till the three and twentieth year of king Joas, the priests did not make the repairs of the temple. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.7"><v id="7"></v>And king Joas called Joiada the high priest and the priests, saying to them: Why do you not repair the temple? Take you therefore money no more according to your order, but restore it for the repairing of the temple. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.8"><v id="8"></v>And the priests were forbidden to take any more money of the people, and to make the repairs of the house. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.9"><v id="9"></v>And Joiada the high priest took a chest and bored a hole in the top, and set it by the altar at the right hand of them that came into the house of the Lord, and the priests that kept the doors put therein all the money that was brought to the temple of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.10"><v id="10"></v>And when they saw that there was very much money in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and poured it out, and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.11"><v id="11"></v>And they gave it out by number and measure into the hands of them that were over the builders of the house of the Lord: and they laid it out to the carpenters, and the masons that wrought in the house of the Lord, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.12"><v id="12"></v>And made the repairs: and to them that cut stones, and to buy timber, and stones, to be hewed, that the repairs of the house of the Lord might be completely finished, and wheresoever there was need of expenses to uphold the house </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.13"><v id="13"></v>But there were not made of the same money for the temple of the Lord, bowls, or fleshhooks, or censers, or trumpets, or any vessel of gold and silver, of the money that was brought into the temple of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.14"><v id="14"></v>For it was given to them that did the work, that the temple of the Lord might be repaired. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.15"><v id="15"></v>And they reckoned not with the men that received the money to distribute it to the workmen, but they bestowed it faithfully. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.16"><v id="16"></v>But the money for trespass, and the money for sine, they brought not into the temple of the Lord, because it was for the priests. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.12.17"><v id="17"></v>Then Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Geth, and took it and set his face to go up to Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.16.4"><v id="4"></v>He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills, and under every green tree. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.16.5"><v id="5"></v>Then Rasin king of Syria, and Phacee son of Romelia king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to fight: and they besieged Achaz, but were not able to overcome him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.16.6"><v id="6"></v>At that time Rasin king of Syria restored Aila to Syria, and drove the men of Juda out of Aila: and the Edomites came into Aila, and dwelt there unto this day. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.16.8"><v id="8"></v>And when he had gathered together the silver and gold that could be found in the house of the Lord, and in the king's treasures, he sent it for a present to the king of the Assyrians. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.16.10"><v id="10"></v>And king Achaz went to Damascus to meet Theglathphalasar king of the Assyrians, end when he had seen the altar of Damascus, king Achaz sent to Urias the priest a pattern of it, and its likeness according to all the work thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.16.11"><v id="11"></v>And Urias the priest built an altar according to all that king Achaz had commanded from Damascus, so did Urias the priest, until king Achaz came from Damascus. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.16.15"><v id="15"></v>And king Achaz commanded Urias the priest saying: Upon the great altar offer the morning holocaust, and the evening sacrifice, and the king's holocaust, and his sacrifice, and the holocaust of the whole people of the land, and their sacrifices, and their libations: and all the blood of the holocaust, and all the blood of the victim thou shalt pour out upon it: but the altar of brass shall be ready at my pleasure. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.5"><v id="5"></v>And he went through all the land: and going up to Samaria, he besieged it three years. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.8"><v id="8"></v>And they walked according to the way of the nations which the Lord had destroyed in the sight of the children of Israel and of the kings of Israel: because they had done in like manner. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.9"><v id="9"></v>And the children of Israel offended the Lord their God with things that were not right: and built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.10"><v id="10"></v>And they made them statues and groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.11"><v id="11"></v>And they burnt incense there upon altars after the manner of the nations which the Lord had removed from their face: and they did wicked things, provoking the Lord. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.13"><v id="13"></v>And the Lord testified to them in Israel and in Juda by the hand of all the prophets and seers, saying: Return from your wicked ways, and keep my precepts, and ceremonies, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers: and as I have sent to you in the hand of my servants the prophets. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.14"><v id="14"></v>And they hearkened not, but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers, who would not obey the Lord their God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.15"><v id="15"></v>And they rejected his ordinances and the covenant that he made with their fathers, and the testimonies which he testified against them: and they followed vanities, and acted vainly: and they followed the nations that were round about them, concerning which the Lord had commanded them that they should not do as they did. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.16"><v id="16"></v>And they forsook all the precepts of the Lord their God: and made to themselves two molten calves, and groves, and adored all the host of heaven: and they served Baal. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.17"><v id="17"></v>And consecrated their sons, and their daughters through fire: and they gave themselves to divinations, and soothsayings: and they delivered themselves up to do evil before the Lord, to provoke him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.18"><v id="18"></v>And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them from his sight, and there remained only the tribe of Juda. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.19"><v id="19"></v>But neither did Juda itself keep the commandments of the Lord their God: but they walked in the errors of Israel, which they had wrought. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.20"><v id="20"></v>And the Lord cast off all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, till he cast them away from his face: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.21"><v id="21"></v>Even from that time, when Israel was rent from the house of David, and made Jeroboam son of Nabat their king: for Jeroboam separated Israel from the Lord, and made them commit a great sin. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.23"><v id="23"></v>Till the Lord removed Israel from his face, as he had spoken in the hand of all his servants the prophets: and Israel was carried away out of their land to Assyria, unto this day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.24"><v id="24"></v>And the king of the Assyrians brought people from Babylon, and from Cutha, and from Avah, and from Emath, and from Sepharvaim: and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.25"><v id="25"></v>And when they began to dwell there, they feared not the Lord: and the Lord sent lions among them, which killed them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.26"><v id="26"></v>And it was told the king of the Assyrians, and it was said: The nations which thou hast removed, and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria, know not the ordinances of the God of the land: and the Lord hath sent lions among them: and behold they kill them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.27"><v id="27"></v>And the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying: Carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from thence captive, and let him go, and dwell with them: and let him teach them the ordinances of the God of the land. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.28"><v id="28"></v>So one of the priests who had been carried away captive from Samaria, came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should worship the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.29"><v id="29"></v>And every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the temples of the high places, which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities where they dwelt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.30"><v id="30"></v>For the men of Babylon made Sochothbenoth: and the Cuthites made Nergel: and the men of Emath made Asima. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.31"><v id="31"></v>And the Hevites made Nebahaz and Tharthac. And they that were of Sepharvaim burnt their children in fire, to Adramelech and Anamelech the gods of Sepharvaim. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.32"><v id="32"></v>And nevertheless they worshipped the Lord. And they made to themselves, of the lowest of the people, priests of the high places, and they placed them in the temples of the high places. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.33"><v id="33"></v>And when they worshipped the Lord, they served also their own gods according to the custom of the nations out of which they were brought to Samaria: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.34"><v id="34"></v>Unto this day they followed the old manner: they fear not the Lord, neither do they keep his ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and the commandment, which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob, whom he surnamed Israel: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.35"><v id="35"></v>With whom he made a covenant, and charged them, saying: You shall not fear strange gods, nor shall you adore them, nor worship them, nor sacrifice to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.36"><v id="36"></v>But the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power, and a stretched out arm, him shall you fear, and him shall you adore, and to him shall you sacrifice. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.37"><v id="37"></v>And the ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do them always: and you shall not fear strange gods. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.38"><v id="38"></v>And the covenant that he made with you, you shall not forget: neither shall ye worship strange gods, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.39"><v id="39"></v>But fear the Lord your God, and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.40"><v id="40"></v>But they did not hearken, but did according to their old custom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.17.41"><v id="41"></v>So these nations feared the Lord, but nevertheless served also their idols: their children also and grandchildren, as their fathers did, so do they unto this day. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.8"><v id="8"></v>He smote the Philistines as far as Gaza, and all their borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.15"><v id="15"></v>And Ezechias gave all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the king's treasures. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.19"><v id="19"></v>And Rabsaces said to them: Speak to Ezechias: Thus saith the great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this confidence, wherein thou trustest? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.20"><v id="20"></v>Perhaps thou hast taken counsel, to prepare thyself for battle. On whom dost thou trust, that thou darest to rebel? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.25"><v id="25"></v>Is it without the will of the Lord that I am come up to this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me: Go up to this land and destroy it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.26"><v id="26"></v>Then Eliacim the son of Helcias, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsaces: We pray thee speak to us thy servants in Syriac: for we understand that tongue: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the hearing of the people that are upon the wall. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.27"><v id="27"></v>And Rabsaces answered them, saying: Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee, to speak these words, and not rather to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their urine with you? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.28"><v id="28"></v>Then Rabsaces stood, and cried out with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said: Hear the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.29"><v id="29"></v>Thus saith the king: Let not Ezechias deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of my hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.30"><v id="30"></v>Neither let him make you trust in the Lord, saying: The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of the Assyrians. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.31"><v id="31"></v>Do not hearken to Ezechias.

<p0><bcv bcv="12.18.32"><v id="32"></v>Till I come, and take you away to a land, like to your own land, a fruitful land, and plentiful in wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olives, and oil and honey, and you shall live, and not die.

<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.3"><v id="3"></v>And they said to him: Thus saith Ezechias: This day is a day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: the children are come to the birth, and the woman in travail hath not strength. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.4"><v id="4"></v>It may be the Lord thy God will hear all the words of Rabsaces, whom the king of the Assyrians his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and to reprove with words, which the Lord thy God hath heard: and do thou offer prayer for the remnants that are found. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.5"><v id="5"></v>So the servants of king Ezechias came to Isaias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.6"><v id="6"></v>And Isaias said to them: Thus shall you say to your master: Thus saith the Lord: Be not afraid for the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.7"><v id="7"></v>Behold I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a message, and shall return into his own country, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own country. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.8"><v id="8"></v>And Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachis. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.9"><v id="9"></v>And when he heard of Theraca king of Ethiopia: Behold, he is come out to fight with thee: and was going against him, he sent messengers to Ezechias, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.10"><v id="10"></v>Thus shall you say to Ezechias king of Juda: Let not thy God deceive thee, in whom thou trustest: and do not say: Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of the Assyrians. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.11"><v id="11"></v>Behold thou hast heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done to all countries, how they have laid them waste: and canst thou alone be delivered? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.12"><v id="12"></v>Have the gods of the nations delivered any of them, whom my fathers have destroyed, to wit, Gozan, and Haran, and Reseph, and the children of Eden that were in Thelassar? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.13"><v id="13"></v>Where is the king of Emath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Ana and of Ava? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.14"><v id="14"></v>And when Ezechias had received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and had read it, he went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.15"><v id="15"></v>And he prayed in his sight, saying: O Lord God of Israel, who sitteth upon the cherubims, thou alone art the God of all the kings of the earth: thou madest heaven and earth: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.16"><v id="16"></v>Incline thy ear, and hear: open, O Lord, thy eyes, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to upbraid unto us the living God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.17"><v id="17"></v>Of a truth, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have destroyed nations, and the lands of them all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.18"><v id="18"></v>And they have cast their gods into the fire: for they were not Rods, but the works of men's hands of wood and stone, and they destroyed them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.19"><v id="19"></v>Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know, that thou art the Lord the only God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.20"><v id="20"></v>And Isaias the son of Amos sent to Ezechias, saying: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I have heard the prayer thou hast made to me concerning Sennacherib king of the Assyrians. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.21"><v id="21"></v>This is the word, that the Lord hath spoken of him: The virgin the daughter of Sion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn: the daughter of Jerusalem hath wagged her head behind thy back. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.22"><v id="22"></v>Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou blasphemed? against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? against the holy one of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.23"><v id="23"></v>By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains, to the top of Libanus, and have cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees. And I have entered into the furthest parts thereof, and the forest of its Carmel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.24"><v id="24"></v>I have cut down, and I have drunk strange waters, and have dried up with the soles of my feet all the shut up waters. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.25"><v id="25"></v>Hast thou not heard what I have done from the beginning? from the days of old I have formed it, and now I have brought it to effect: that fenced cities of fighting men should be turned to heaps of ruin: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.26"><v id="26"></v>And the inhabitants of them, were weak of hand, they trembled and were confounded, they became like the grass of the field, and the green herb on the tops of houses, which withered before it came to maturity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.27"><v id="27"></v>Thy dwelling and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy way I knew before, and thy rage against me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.28"><v id="28"></v>Thou hast been mad against me, and thy pride hath come up to my ears: therefore I will put a ring in thy nose, and a bit between thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way, by which thou camest. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.29"><v id="29"></v>And to thee, O Ezechias, this shall be a sign: Eat this year what thou shalt find: and in the second year, such things as spring of themselves: but in the third year sow and reap: plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.30"><v id="30"></v>And whatsoever shall be left of the house of Juda, shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.31"><v id="31"></v>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and that which shall be saved out of mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.32"><v id="32"></v>Wherefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a trench about it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.33"><v id="33"></v>By the way that he came, he shall return: and into this city he shall not come, saith the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.34"><v id="34"></v>And I will protect this city, and will save it for my own sake, and for David my servant's sake. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.35"><v id="35"></v>And it came to pass that night, that an angel of the Lord came, and slew in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when he arose early in the morning, he saw all the bodies of the dead. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.36"><v id="36"></v>And Sennacherib king of the Assyrians departing went away, and he re- turned and abode in Ninive. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.19.37"><v id="37"></v>And as he was worshipping in the temple of Nesroch his god, Adramelech and Sarasar his sons slew him with the sword, and they fled into the land of the Armenians, and Asarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.1"><v id="1"></v>In those days Ezechias was sick unto death: and Isaias the son of Amos the prophet came and said to him: Thus saith the Lord God: Give charge concerning thy house, for thou shalt die, and not live. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.2"><v id="2"></v>And he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.3"><v id="3"></v>I beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is pleasing before thee. And Ezechias wept with much weeping. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.4"><v id="4"></v>And before Isaias was gone out of the middle of the court, the word of the Lord came to him, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.5"><v id="5"></v>Go back, and tell Ezechias the captain of my people: Thus saith the Lord the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, and I have seen thy tears: and behold I have healed thee; on the third day thou shalt go up to the temple of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.6"><v id="6"></v>And I will add to thy days fifteen years: and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will protect this city for my own sake, and for David my servant's sake. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.7"><v id="7"></v>And Isaias said: Bring me a lump of figs. And when they had brought it, and laid it upon his boil. he was healed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.8"><v id="8"></v>And Ezechias had said to Isaias: What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up to the temple of the Lord the third day? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.9"><v id="9"></v>And Isaias said to him: This shall be the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do the word which he hath spoken: Wilt thou that the shadow go forward ten lines, or that it go back so many degrees? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.10"><v id="10"></v>And Ezechias said: It is an easy matter for the shadow to go forward ten lines: and I do not desire that this be done, but let it return back ten degrees. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.11"><v id="11"></v>And Isaias the prophet called upon the Lord, and he brought the shadow ten degrees backwards by the lines, by which it had already gone down in the dial of Achaz. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.12"><v id="12"></v>At that time Berodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of the Babylonians, sent letters and presents to Ezechias: for he had heard that Ezechias had been sick. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.13"><v id="13"></v>And Ezechias rejoiced at their coming, and he showed them the house of his aromatical spices, and the gold and the silver, and divers precious odours, and ointments, and the house of his vessels, and all that he had in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominions that Ezechias shewed them not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.14"><v id="14"></v>And Isaias the prophet came to king Ezechias, and said to him: What said these men? or from whence came they to thee? And Ezechias said to him: From a far country they came to me out of Babylon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.15"><v id="15"></v>And he said: What did they see in thy house? Ezechias said: They saw all the things that are in my house: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewn them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.20.16"><v id="16"></v>And Isaias said to Ezechias: Hear the word of the Lord. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.2"><v id="2"></v>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to the idols of the nations, which the Lord destroyed from before the face of the children of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.3"><v id="3"></v>And he turned, and built up the high places which Ezechias his father had destroyed: and he set up altars to Baal, and made groves, as Achab the king of Israel had done: and he adored all the host of heaven, and served them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.4"><v id="4"></v>And he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said: In Jerusalem I will put my name. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.5"><v id="5"></v>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the temple of the Lord. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.7"><v id="7"></v>He set also an idol of the grove, which he had made, in the temple of the Lord: concerning which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son: In this temple, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.8"><v id="8"></v>And I will no more make the feet of Israel to be moved out of the land, which I gave to their fathers: only if they will observe to do all that I have commanded them according to the law which my servant Moses commanded them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.9"><v id="9"></v>But they hearkened not: but were seduced by Manasses, to do evil more than the nations which the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.10"><v id="10"></v>And the Lord spoke in the hand of his servants, the prophets, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.11"><v id="11"></v>Because Manasses king of Juda hath done these most wicked abominations, beyond all that the Amorrhites did before him, and hath made Juda also to sin with his filthy doings: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.12"><v id="12"></v>Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Behold I will bring on evils upon Jerusalem and Juda: that whosoever shall hear of them, both his ears shall tingle. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.13"><v id="13"></v>And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the weight of the house of Achab: and I will efface Jerusalem, as tables are wont to be effaced, and I will erase and turn it, and draw the pencil often over the face thereof. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.15"><v id="15"></v>Because they have done evil before me, and have continued to provoke me, from the day that their fathers came out of Egypt, even unto this day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.21.16"><v id="16"></v>Moreover Manasses shed also very much innocent blood, till he filled Jerusalem up to the mouth: besides his sins, wherewith he made Juda to sin, to do evil before the Lord. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.22.7"><v id="7"></v>But let there be no reckoning made with them of the money which they receive, but let them have it in their power, and in their trust. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.22.8"><v id="8"></v>And Helcias the high priest said to Saphan the scribe: I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord: and Helcias gave the book to Saphan, and he read it. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.4"><v id="4"></v>And the king commanded Helcias the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to cast out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that had been made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burnt them without Jerusalem in the valley of Cedron, and he carried the ashes of them to Bethel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.5"><v id="5"></v>And he destroyed the soothsayers, whom the kings of Juda had appointed to sacrifice in the high places in the cities of Juda, and round about Jerusalem: them also that burnt incense to Baal, and to the sun, and to the moon, and to the twelve signs, and to all the host of heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.6"><v id="6"></v>And he caused the grove to be carried out from the house of the Lord without Jerusalem to the valley of Cedron, and he burnt it there, and reduced it to dust, and cast the dust upon the graves of the common people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.7"><v id="7"></v>He destroyed also the pavilions of the effeminate, which were in the house of the Lord, for which the women wove as it were little dwellings for the grove. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.8"><v id="8"></v>And he gathered together all the priests out of the cities of Juda: and he defiled the high places, where the priests offered sacrifice, from Gabaa to Bersabee: and he broke down the altars of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Josue governor of tile city, which was on the left hand of the gate of the city. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.9"><v id="9"></v>However the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem: but only ate of the unleavened bread among their brethren. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.10"><v id="10"></v>And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Ennom: that no man should consecrate there his son or his daughter through fire to Moloch. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.11"><v id="11"></v>And he took away the horses which the kings of Juda had given to the sun, at the entering in of the temple of the Lord, near the chamber of Nathanmelech the eunuch, who was in Pharurim: and he burnt the chariots of the sun with fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.12"><v id="12"></v>And the altars that were upon the top of the upper chamber of Achaz, which the kings of Juda had made, and the altars which Manasses had made in the two courts of the temple of the Lord, the king broke down: and he ran from thence, and cast the ashes of them into the torrent Cedron. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.13"><v id="13"></v>The high places also that were at Jerusalem on the right side of the Mount of Offence, which Solomon king of Israel had built to Astaroth the idol of the Sidonians, and to Chamos the scandal of Moab, and to Melchom the abomination of the children of Ammon, the king defiled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.14"><v id="14"></v>And he broke in pieces the statues, and cut down the groves: and he filled their places with the bones of dead men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.15"><v id="15"></v>Moreover the altar also that was at Bethel, and the high place, which Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, had made: both the altar, and the high place he broke down and burnt, and reduced to powder, and burnt the grove. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.16"><v id="16"></v>And as Josias turned himself, he saw there the sepulchres that were in the mount: and he sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burnt them upon the altar, and defiled it according to the word of the Lord, which the man of God spoke, who had foretold these things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.17"><v id="17"></v>And he said: What is that monument which I see? And the men of that city answered: It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Juda, and foretold these things which thou hast done upon the altar of Bethel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.18"><v id="18"></v>And he said: Let him alone, let no man move his bones. So his bones were left untouched with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.19"><v id="19"></v>Moreover all the temples of the high places, which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord, Josias took away: and he did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.20"><v id="20"></v>And he slew all the priests of the high places, that were there, upon the altars: and he burnt men's bones upon them: and returned to Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.21"><v id="21"></v>And he commanded all the people, saying: Keep the phase to the Lord your God, according as it is written in the book of this covenant. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.22"><v id="22"></v>Now there was no such a phase kept from the days of the judges, who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.23"><v id="23"></v>As was this phase that was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem, in the eighteenth year of king Josias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.24"><v id="24"></v>Moreover the diviners by spirits, and soothsayers, and the figures of idols, and the uncleannesses, and the abominations, that had been in the land of Juda, and Jerusalem, Josias took away: that he might perform the words of the law, that were written in the book which Helcias the priest had found in the temple of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.25"><v id="25"></v>There was no king before him like unto him, that returned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with ail his strength, according to all the law of Moses: neither after him did there arise any like him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.26"><v id="26"></v>But yet the Lord turned not away from the wrath of his great indignation, wherewith his anger was kindled against Juda: because of the provocations, wherewith Manasses had provoked him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.27"><v id="27"></v>And the Lord said: I will remove Juda also from before my face, as I have removed Israel: and I will cast off this city Jerusalem, which I chose, and the house, of which I said: My name shall be there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.28"><v id="28"></v>Now the rest of the acts of Josias, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.29"><v id="29"></v>In his days Pharao Nechao king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josias went to meet him: and was slain at Mageddo, when he had seen him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.30"><v id="30"></v>And his servants carried him dead from Mageddo: and they brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in Iris own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias: and they anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.31"><v id="31"></v>Joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias of Lobna. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.32"><v id="32"></v>And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.33"><v id="33"></v>And Pharao Nechao bound him at Rebla, which is in the land of Emath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem: and he set a fine upon the land, of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.34"><v id="34"></v>And Pharao Nechao made Eliacim the son of Josias king in the room of Josias his father: and turned his name to Joakim. And he took Joachaz away and carried him into Egypt, and he died there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.35"><v id="35"></v>And Joakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharao, after he had taxed the land for every man, to contribute according to the commandment of Pharao: and he exacted both the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every man according to his ability: to give to Pharao Nechao. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="12.23.36"><v id="36"></v>Joakim was five and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Zebida the daughter of Phadaia of Ruma. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.24.3"><v id="3"></v>And this came by the word of the Lord against Juda, to remove them from before him for all the sins of Manasses which he did. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.24.7"><v id="7"></v>And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his own country: for the king of Babylon had taken all that had belonged to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt, unto the river Euphrates. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="12.25.5"><v id="5"></v>And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all the warriors that were with him were scattered, and left him: </bcv></p0>
