<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.1"><v id="1"></v>The words of Ecclesiastes, the son of David, king of Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.2"><v id="2"></v>Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes vanity of vanities, and all is vanity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.3"><v id="3"></v>What hath a man more of all his labour, that he taketh under the sun? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.4"><v id="4"></v>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth standeth for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.5"><v id="5"></v>The sun riseth, and goeth down, and returneth to his place: and there rising again, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.6"><v id="6"></v>Maketh his round by the south, and turneth again to the north: the spirit goeth forward surveying all places round about, and returneth to his circuits. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.7"><v id="7"></v>All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea doth not overflow: unto the place from whence the rivers come, they return, to flow again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.8"><v id="8"></v>All things are hard: man cannot explain them by word. The eye is not filled with seeing, neither is the ear filled with hearing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.9"><v id="9"></v>What is it that hath been? the same thing that shall be. What is it that hath been done? the same that shall be done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.10"><v id="10"></v>Nothing under the sun is new, neither is any man able to say: Behold this is new: for it hath already gone before in the ages that were before us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.11"><v id="11"></v>There is no remembrance of former things: nor indeed of those things which hereafter are to come, shall there be any remembrance with them that shall be in the latter end. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.12"><v id="12"></v>I Ecclesiastes was king over Israel in Jerusalem, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.13"><v id="13"></v>And I proposed in my mind to seek and search out wisely concerning all things that are done under the sun. This painful occupation hath God given to the children of men, to be exercised therein. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.14"><v id="14"></v>I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold all is vanity, and vexation of spirit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.15"><v id="15"></v>The perverse are hard to be corrected, and the number of fools is infinite. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.1.17"><v id="17"></v>And I have given my heart to know prudence, and learning, and errors, and folly: and I have perceived that in these also there was labour, and vexation of spirit, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.1"><v id="1"></v>I said in my heart: I will go, and abound with delights, and enjoy good things. And I saw that this also was vanity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.2"><v id="2"></v>Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.3"><v id="3"></v>I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.4"><v id="4"></v>I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.5"><v id="5"></v>I made gardens, and orchards, and set them with trees of all kinds, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.6"><v id="6"></v>And I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood of the young trees, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.7"><v id="7"></v>I got me menservants, and maidservants, and had a great family: and herds of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in Jerusalem: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.8"><v id="8"></v>I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and provinces: I made me singing men, and singing women, and the delights of the sons of men, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.9"><v id="9"></v>And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem: my wisdom also remained with me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.10"><v id="10"></v>And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.11"><v id="11"></v>And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of mind, and that nothing was lasting under the sun. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.12"><v id="12"></v>I passed further to behold wisdom, and errors and folly, (What is man, said I, that he can follow the King his maker?) </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.13"><v id="13"></v>And I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as much as light differeth from darkness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.14"><v id="14"></v>The eyes of a wise man are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness: and I learned that they were to die both alike. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.15"><v id="15"></v>And I said in my heart: If the death of the fool and mine shall be one, what doth it avail me, that I have applied myself more to the study of wisdom? And speaking with my own mind, I perceived that this also was vanity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.16"><v id="16"></v>For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the fool for ever, and the times to come shall cover all things together with oblivion: the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.17"><v id="17"></v>And therefore I was weary of my life, when I saw that all things under the sun are evil, and all vanity and vexation of spirit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.18"><v id="18"></v>Again I hated all my application wherewith I had earnestly laboured under the sun, being like to have an heir after me, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.19"><v id="19"></v>Whom I know not whether he will be a wise man or a fool, and he shall have rule over all my labours with which I have laboured and been solicitous: and is there any thing so vain? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.20"><v id="20"></v>Wherefore I left off and my heart renounced labouring any more under the sun. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.21"><v id="21"></v>For when a man laboureth in wisdom, and knowledge, and carefulness, he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man: so this also is vanity, and a great evil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.22"><v id="22"></v>For what profit shall a man have of all his labour, and vexation of spirit, with which he bath been tormented under the sun? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.23"><v id="23"></v>All his days axe full of sorrows and miseries, even in the night he doth not rest in mind: and is not this vanity? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.24"><v id="24"></v>Is it not better to eat and drink, and to shew his soul good things of his labours? and this is from the hand of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.25"><v id="25"></v>Who shall so feast and abound with delights as I? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.2.26"><v id="26"></v>God hath given to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he hath given vexation, and superfluous care, to heap up and to gather together, and to give it to him that hath pleased God: but this also is vanity, and a fruitless solicitude of the mind. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.10"><v id="10"></v>I have seen the trouble, which God hath given the sons of men to be exercised in it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.11"><v id="11"></v>He hath made all things good in their time, and hath delivered the world to their consideration, so that man cannot flnd out the work which God hath made from the beginning to the end. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.12"><v id="12"></v>And I have known that there was no better thing than to rejoice, and to do well in this life. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.14"><v id="14"></v>I have learned that all the works which God hath made, continue for ever: we cannot add any thing, nor take away from those things which God hath made that he may be feared. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.15"><v id="15"></v>That which hath been made, the same continueth: the things that shall be, have already been: and God restoreth that which is past. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.16"><v id="16"></v>I saw under the sun in the place of judgment wickedness, and in the place of justice iniquity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.17"><v id="17"></v>And I said in my heart: God shall judge both the just and the wicked, and then shall be the time of every thing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.18"><v id="18"></v>I said in my heart concerning the sons of men, that God would prove them, and shew them to be like beasts. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.19"><v id="19"></v>Therefore the death of man, and of beasts is one, and the condition of them both is equal: as man dieth, so they also die: all things breathe alike, and man hath nothing more than beast: all things are subject to vanity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.20"><v id="20"></v>And all things go to one place: of earth they were made, and into earth they return together. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.3.22"><v id="22"></v>And I have found that nothing is better than for a man to rejoice in his work, and that this is his portion. For who shall bring him to know the things that shall be after him? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.4.4"><v id="4"></v>Again I considered all the labours of men, and I remarked that their industries are exposed to the envy of their neighhour: so in this also there is vanity, and fruitless care. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.4.5"><v id="5"></v>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh, saying: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.4.7"><v id="7"></v>Considering I found also another vanity under the sun: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.4.8"><v id="8"></v>There is but one, and he hath not a second, no child, no brother, and yet he ceaseth not to labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches, neither doth he reflect, saying: For whom do I labour, and defraud my soul of good things? in this also is vanity, and a grievous vexation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.4.9"><v id="9"></v>It is better therefore that two should be together, than one: for they have the advantage of their society: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.4.10"><v id="10"></v>If one fall he shall be supported by the other: woe to him that is alone, for when he falleth, he hath none to lift him up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.4.11"><v id="11"></v>And if two lie together, they shall warm one another: how shall one alone be warmed? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.4.12"><v id="12"></v>And if a man prevail against one, two shall withstand him: a threefold cord is not easily broken. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.4.13"><v id="13"></v>Better is a child that is poor and wise, than a king that is old and foolish, who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.4.14"><v id="14"></v>Because out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a kingdom: and another born king is consumed with poverty. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.8.3"><v id="3"></v>Be not hasty to depart from his face, and do not continue in an evil work: for he will do all that pleaseth him: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.8.6"><v id="6"></v>There is a time and opportunity for every business, and great affliction for man: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.8.7"><v id="7"></v>Because he is ignorant of things past, and things to come he cannot know by any messenger. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.8.8"><v id="8"></v>It is not in man's power to stop the spirit, neither hath he power in the day of death, neither is he suffered to rest when war is at hand, neither shall wickedness save the wicked. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.8.9"><v id="9"></v>All these things I have considered, and applied my heart to all the works that are done under the sun. Sometimes one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.8.10"><v id="10"></v>I saw the wicked buried: who also when they were yet living were in the holy place, and were praised in the city as men of just works: but this also is vanity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.8.11"><v id="11"></v>For because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.8.12"><v id="12"></v>But though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and by patience be borne withal, I know from thence that it shall be well with them that fear God, who dread his face. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.8.16"><v id="16"></v>And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to understand the distraction that is upon earth: for there are some that day and night take no sleep with their eyes. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.9.2"><v id="2"></v>But all things are kept uncertain for the time to come, because all things equally happen to the just and to the wicked, to the good and to the evil, to the clean and to the unclean, to him that offereth victims, and to him that despiseth sacrifices. As the good is, so also is the sinner: as the perjured, so he also that sweareth truth. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="21.9.10"><v id="10"></v>Whatsoever thy hand is able to do, do it earnestly: for neither work, nor reason, nor wisdom, nor knowledge shall be in hell, whither thou art hastening. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.9.11"><v id="11"></v>I turned me to another thing, and I saw that under the sun, the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the learned, nor favour to the skilful: but time and chance in all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.9.12"><v id="12"></v>Man knoweth not his own end: but as fishes are taken with the hook, and as birds are caught with the snare, so men are taken in the evil time, when it shall suddenly come upon them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.9.13"><v id="13"></v>This wisdom also I have seen under the sun, and it seemed to me to be very great: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.9.14"><v id="14"></v>A little city, and few men in it: there came against it a great king, and invested it, and built bulwarks round about it, and the siege was perfect. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.9.15"><v id="15"></v>Now there was found in it a man poor and wise, and he delivered the city by his wisdom, and no man afterward remembered that poor man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.9.16"><v id="16"></v>And I said that wisdom is better than strength: how then is the wisdom of the poor man slighted, and his words not heard? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="21.9.17"><v id="17"></v>The words of the wise are heard in silence, more than the cry of a prince among fools. </bcv></p0>
