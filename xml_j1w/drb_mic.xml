<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.1"><v id="1"></v>The word of the Lord that came to Micheas the Morasthite, in the days of Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda: which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.2"><v id="2"></v>Hear, all ye people: and let the earth give ear, and all that is therein: and let the Lord God be a witness to you, the Lord from his holy temple. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.3"><v id="3"></v>For behold the Lord will come forth out of his place: and he will come down, and will tread upon the high places of the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.4"><v id="4"></v>And the mountains shall be melted under him: and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as waters that run down a steep place. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.5"><v id="5"></v>For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the wickedness of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Juda? are they not Jerusalem ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.6"><v id="6"></v>And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a vineyard is planted: and I will bring down the stones thereof into the valley, and will lay her foundations bare. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.7"><v id="7"></v>And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces, and all her wages shall be burnt with fire, and I will bring to destruction all her idols: for they were gathered together of the hire of a harlot, and unto the hire of a harlot they shall return. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.8"><v id="8"></v>Therefore will I lament and howl: I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and a mourning like the ostriches. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.9"><v id="9"></v>Because her wound is desperate, because it is come even to Juda, it hath touched the gate of my people even to Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.10"><v id="10"></v>Declare ye it not in Geth, weep ya not with tears: in the house of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.11"><v id="11"></v>And pass away, O thou that dwellest in the Beautiful place, covered with thy shame: she went not forth that dwelleth in the confines: the House adjoining shall receive mourning from you, which stood by herself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.12"><v id="12"></v>For she is become weak unto good that dwelleth in bitterness: for evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.13"><v id="13"></v>A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of Lachis: it is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Sion, for in thee were found the crimes of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.14"><v id="14"></v>Therefore shall she send messengers to the inheritance of Geth : the houses of lying to deceive the kings of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.15"><v id="15"></v>Yet will I bring an heir to thee that dwellest in Maresa: even to Odollam shall the glory of Israel come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.1.16"><v id="16"></v>Make thee bald, and be polled for thy delicate children: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle: for they are carried into captivity from thee. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="33.2.8"><v id="8"></v>But my people, on the contrary, are risen up as an enemy: you have taken away the cloak off from the coat: and them that passed harmless you have turned to war. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="33.2.12"><v id="12"></v>I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O Jacob: I will bring together the remnant of Israel, I will put them together as a flock in the fold, as the sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes, they shall make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="33.3.5"><v id="5"></v>Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err: that bite with their teeth, and preach peace: and if a man give not something into their mouth, they prepare war against him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.3.6"><v id="6"></v>Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision, and darkness to you instead of divination; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be darkened over them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="33.3.7"><v id="7"></v>And they shall be confounded that see visions, and the diviners shall be confounded: and they shall all cover their faces, because there is no answer of God. </bcv></p0>
