And the fire of the Lord being kindled against them, devoured them that were at the uttermost part of the camp. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.2"><v id="2"></v>And when the people cried to Moses, Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire was swallowed up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.3"><v id="3"></v>And he called the name of that place, The burning: for that the fire of the Lord had been kindled against them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.4"><v id="4"></v>For a mixt multitude of people, that came up with them, burned with desire, sitting and weeping, the children of Israel also being joined with them, and said: Who shall give us flesh to eat? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.5"><v id="5"></v>We remember the Ash that we ate in Egypt free cost: the cucumbers come into our mind, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.7"><v id="7"></v>A Now the manna was like coriander seed, of the colour of bdellium. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.8"><v id="8"></v>And the people went about, and gathering it, ground it in a mill, or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot, and made cakes thereof of the taste of bread tempered with oil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.9"><v id="9"></v>and when the dew fell in the night upon the camp, the manna also fell with it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.10"><v id="10"></v>Now Moses heard the people weeping by their families, every one at the door of his tent. And the wrath of the Lord was exceedingly enkindled: to Moses also the thing seemed insupportable. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.11"><v id="11"></v>And he said to the Lord: Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? wherefore do I not find favour before thee? and why hast thou laid the weight of all this people upon me ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.12"><v id="12"></v>Have I conceived all this multitude, or begotten them, that thou shouldst say to me: Carry them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to carry the little infant, and bear them into the land, for which thou hast sworn to their fathers? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.13"><v id="13"></v>Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a multitude? they weep against me, saying: Give us flesh that we may eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.14"><v id="14"></v>I am not able alone to bear all this people, because it is too heavy for me. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.16"><v id="16"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: Gather unto me seventy men of the ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be ancients and masters of the people: and thou shalt bring them to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant, and shalt make them stand there with thee, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.17"><v id="17"></v>That I may come down and speak with thee: and I will take of thy spirit, and will give to them, that they may bear with thee the burden of the people, and thou mayest not be burthened alone. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.18"><v id="18"></v>And thou shalt say to the people: Be ye sanctified : to morrow you shall eat flesh: for I have heard you say: Who will give us flesh to eat? it was well with us in Egypt. That the Lord may give you flesh, and you may eat: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.19"><v id="19"></v>Not for one day, nor two, nor five, nor ten, no nor for twenty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.20"><v id="20"></v>But even for a month of days, till it come out at your nostrils, and become loathsome to you, because you have cast off the Lord, who is in the midst of you, and have wept before him, saying: Why came we out of Egypt? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.21"><v id="21"></v>And Moses said: There are six hundred thousand footmen of this people, and sayest thou: I will give them flesh to eat a whole month? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.22"><v id="22"></v>Shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed, that it may suffice for their food? or shall the fishes of the sea be gathered together to fill them? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.23"><v id="23"></v>And the Lord answered him: Is the hand of the Lord unable? Thou shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass or no. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.24"><v id="24"></v>Moses therefore came, and told the people the words of the Lord, and assembled seventy men of the ancients of Israel, and made them to stand about the tabernacle. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.25"><v id="25"></v>And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, taking away of the spirit that was in Moses, and giving to the seventy men. And when the spirit had rested on them they prophesied, nor did they cease afterwards. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.26"><v id="26"></v>Now there remained in the camp two of the men, of whom one was called Eldad, and the other Medad, upon whom the spirit rested; for they also had been enrolled, but were not gone forth to the tabernacle. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.27"><v id="27"></v>And when they prophesied in the camp, there ran a young man, and told Moses, saying: Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.28"><v id="28"></v>Forthwith Josue the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and chosen out of many, said: My lord Moses forbid them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.29"><v id="29"></v>But he said: Why hast thou emulation for me? O that all the people might prophesy, and that the Lord would give them his spirit! </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.30"><v id="30"></v>And Moses returned, with the ancients of Israel, into the camp. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.31"><v id="31"></v>And a wind going out from the Lord, taking quails up beyond the sea brought them, and cast them into the camp for the space of one day's journey, on every side of the camp round about, and they flew in the air two cubits high above the ground. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.32"><v id="32"></v>The people therefore rising up all that day, and night, and the next day, gathered together of quails, he that did least, ten cores: and they dried them round about the camp. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.33"><v id="33"></v>As yet the flesh was between their teeth, neither had that kind of meat failed: when behold the wrath of the Lord being provoked against the people, struck them with an exceeding great plague. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.11.34"><v id="34"></v>And that place was called, The graves of lust: for there they buried the people that had lusted. And departing from the graves of lust, they came unto Haseroth, and abode there. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.12.9"><v id="9"></v>And being angry with them he went away: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.12.10"><v id="10"></v>The cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed: and behold Mary appeared white as snow with a leprosy. And when Aaron had looked on her, and saw her all covered with leprosy, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.12.12"><v id="12"></v>Let her not be as one dead, and as an abortive that is cast forth from the mother's womb. Lo, now one half of her flesh is consumed with the leprosy. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.12.13"><v id="13"></v>And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: O God, I beseech thee heal her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.12.14"><v id="14"></v>And the Lord answered him: If her father had spitten upon her face, ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at least? Let her be separated seven days without the camp, and after wards she shall be called again. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.26"><v id="26"></v>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.28"><v id="28"></v>Say therefore to them: As I live, saith the Lord: According as you have spoken in my hearing, so will I do to you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.29"><v id="29"></v>fin the wilderness shall your carcasses lie. All you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward, and have murmured against me, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.30"><v id="30"></v>Shall not enter into the land, over which I lifted up my bend to make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephone, and Josue the son of Nun. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.31"><v id="31"></v>But your children, of whom you said, that they should be a prey to the enemies, will I bring in: that they may see the land which you have despised. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.33"><v id="33"></v>Your children shall wander in the desert forty years, and shall bear your fornication, until the carcasses of their fathers be consumed ill the desert, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.34"><v id="34"></v>According to the number of the forty days, wherein you viewed the land: a year shall be counted for a day. And forty years you shall receive your iniquities, and shall know my revenge: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.35"><v id="35"></v>For as I have spoken, so will I do to all this wicked multitude, that hath risen up together against me: in this wilderness shall it faint away and die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.36"><v id="36"></v>Therefore all the men, whom Moses had sent to view the land, and who at their return had made the whole multitude to murmur against him, speaking ill of the land that it was naught, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.37"><v id="37"></v>Died and were struck in the sight of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.38"><v id="38"></v>But Josue .the son of Nun. and Caleb the son of Jephone lived, of all them that had gone to view the land. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.39"><v id="39"></v>And Moses spoke all these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned exceedingly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.40"><v id="40"></v>And behold rising up very early in the morning, they went up to the top of the mountain, and said: We are ready to go up to the place, of which the Lord hath spoken: for we have sinned. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.41"><v id="41"></v>And Moses said to them: Why transgress you the word of the Lord, which shall not succeed prosperously with you? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.43"><v id="43"></v>The Amalecite and the Chanaanite are before you, and by their sword you shall fall, because you would not consent to the Lord, neither will the Lord be with you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.44"><v id="44"></v>But they being blinded went up to the top of the mountain. But the ark of the testament of the Lord and Moses departed not from the camp. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.14.45"><v id="45"></v>And the Amalecite came down, and the Chanaanite that dwelt in the mountain: and smiting and slaying them pursued them as far as Horma. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.15.25"><v id="25"></v>And the priest shall pray for all the multitude of the children of Israel: and it shall be forgiven them, because they sinned ignorantly, offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the Lord for themselves and for their sin and their ignorance: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.2"><v id="2"></v>Rose lap against Moses, and with them two hundred and fifty others of the children of Israel, leading men of the synagogue, and who in the time of assembly were called by name. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.3"><v id="3"></v>And when they had stood up against Moses and Aaron, they said: Let it be enough for you, that all the multitude consisteth of holy ones, and the Lord is among them: Why lift you up yourselves above the people of the Lord? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.4"><v id="4"></v>When Moses heard this, he fell flat on his face: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.8"><v id="8"></v>And he said again to Core: Hear ye sons of Levi. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.9"><v id="9"></v>Is it a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath spared you from all the people, and joined you to himself, that you should serve him in the service of the tabernacle, and should stand before the congregation of the people, and should minister to him? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.10"><v id="10"></v>Did he therefore make thee and all thy brethren the sons of Levi to approach unto him, that you should challenge to yourselves the priesthood also, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.11"><v id="11"></v>And that all thy company should stand against the Lord ? for what is Aaron that you murmur against him? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.12"><v id="12"></v>Then Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab. But they answered: We will not come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.13"><v id="13"></v>Is it a small matter to thee, that thou hast brought us out of a land that flowed with milk and honey, to kill us in the desert, except thou rule also like a lord over us? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.14"><v id="14"></v>Thou best brought us indeed into a land that floweth with rivers of milk and honey, and hast given us possessions of fields and vineyards; wilt thou also pull out our eyes? We will not come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.15"><v id="15"></v>Moses therefore being very angry, raid to the Lord: Respect not their sacrifices: thou knowest that I have not taken of them so much as a young ass at any time, nor have injured any of them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.16"><v id="16"></v>And he said to Core: Do thou and thy congregation stand apart before the Lord to morrow, and Aaron apart. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.17"><v id="17"></v>Take every one of you censers, and put incense upon them, offering to the Lord two hundred and fifty censers: let Aaron also hold his censer. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.21"><v id="21"></v>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may presently destroy them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.22"><v id="22"></v>They fell flat on their face, and said: O most mighty, the God of the spirits of all flesh, for one man's sin shall thy wrath rage against all? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.23"><v id="23"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.25"><v id="25"></v>And Moses arose, and went to Dathan and Abiron: and the ancients of Israel following him, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.26"><v id="26"></v>He said to the multitude: Depart from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be involved in their sins. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.27"><v id="27"></v>And when they were departed from their tents round about, Dathan and Abiron coming out stood in the entry of their pavilions with their wives and children, and all the people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.28"><v id="28"></v>And Moses said: By this you shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all things that you see, and that I have not forged them of my own head: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.29"><v id="29"></v>If these men die the common death of men, and if they be visited with a plague, wherewith others also are wont to be visited, the Lord did not send me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.30"><v id="30"></v>But if the Lord do a new thing, and the earth opening her mouth swallow them down, and all things that belong to them, and they go down alive into hell, you shall know that they have blasphemed the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.31"><v id="31"></v>And immediately as he had made an end of speaking, the earth broke asunder under their feet: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.32"><v id="32"></v>And opening her mouth, devoured them with their tents and all their substance. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.33"><v id="33"></v>And they went down alive into hell the ground closing upon them, and they perished from among the people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.34"><v id="34"></v>But all Israel, that was standing round about, fled at the cry of them that were perishing: saying: Lest perhaps the earth swallow us up also. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.35"><v id="35"></v>And a fire coming out from the Lord, destroyed the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.36"><v id="36"></v>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.37"><v id="37"></v>Command Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers that lie in the burning, and to scatter the fire of one side and the other: because they are sanctified </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.38"><v id="38"></v>In the deaths of the sinners: and let him beat them into plates, and fasten them to the altar, because incense hath been offered in them to the Lord, and they are sanctified, that the children of Israel may see them for a sign and a memorial. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.39"><v id="39"></v>Then Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherein they had offered, whom the burning fire had devoured, and beat them into plates, fastening them to the altar: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.40"><v id="40"></v>That the children of Israel might have for the time to come wherewith they should be admonished, that no stranger or any one that is not of seed of Aaron should come near to offer incense to the Lord, lest he should suffer as Core suffered, and all his congregation, according as the Lord spoke to Moses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.41"><v id="41"></v>The following day all the multitude of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying: You have killed the people of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.42"><v id="42"></v>And when there arose a sedition, and the tumult increased, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.43"><v id="43"></v>Moses and Aaron fled to the tabernacle of the covenant. And when the were gone into it, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.44"><v id="44"></v>And the Lord said to Moses: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.45"><v id="45"></v>Get you out from the midst of this multitude, this moment will I destroy them. And as they were lying on the ground, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.46"><v id="46"></v>Moses said to Aaron: Take the censer, and putting fire in it from the altar, put incense upon it, and go quickly to the people to pray for them: for already wrath is gone out from the Lord, and the plague rageth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.47"><v id="47"></v>When Aaron had done this, and had run to the midst of the multitude which the burning fire was now destroying, he offered the incense: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.48"><v id="48"></v>And standing between the dead and the living, he prayed for the people, and the plague ceased. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.49"><v id="49"></v>And the number of them that were slain was fourteen thousand and seven hundred men, besides them that had perished in the sedition of Core. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.16.50"><v id="50"></v>And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant after the destruction was over. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.20.16"><v id="16"></v>And how we cried to the Lord, and he heard us, and sent an angel, who hath brought us out of Egypt. Lo, we are now in the city of Cades, which is in the uttermost of thy borders, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.20.17"><v id="17"></v>And we beseech thee that we may have leave to pass through thy country.

<p0><bcv bcv="4.20.18"><v id="18"></v>And Edom answered them: Thou shalt not pass by me: if thou dost I will come out armed against thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.20.19"><v id="19"></v>And the children of Israel said: We will go by the beaten way: and if we and our cattle drink of thy waters, we will give thee what is just: there shall be no difficulty in the price, only let us pass speedily. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.20.20"><v id="20"></v>But he answered: Thou shalt not pass. And immediately he came forth to meet them with an infinite multitude, and a strong hand, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.21.2"><v id="2"></v>But Israel binding himself by vow to the Lord, said: It thou wilt deliver this people into my hand, I will utterly destroy their cities. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.21.4"><v id="4"></v>And they marched from mount Hor, by the way that leadeth to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom. And the people began to be weary of their journey and labour: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.21.16"><v id="16"></v>When they went from that place, the well appeared whereof the Lord said to Moses: Gather the people together, and I will give them water. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.21.23"><v id="23"></v>And he would not grant that Israel should pass by his borders: but rather gathering an army, went forth to meet them in the desert, and came to Jasa, and fought against them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.21.24"><v id="24"></v>And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword, and they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc, and to the confines of the children of Ammon: for the borders of the Ammonites, were kept with a strong garrison. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.21.25"><v id="25"></v>So Israel took all his cities, and dwelt in the cities of the Amorrhite, to wit, in Hesebon, and in the villages thereof. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.1"><v id="1"></v>And they went forward and encamped in the plains of Moab, over against where Jericho is situate beyond the Jordan. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.2"><v id="2"></v>And Balac the son of Sephor, seeing all that Israel had done to the Amorrhite, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.3"><v id="3"></v>And that the Moabites were in great fear of him, and were not able to sustain his assault, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.4"><v id="4"></v>He said to the elders of Madian: So will this people destroy all that dwell in our borders, as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the very roots. Now he was at that time king in Moab. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.5"><v id="5"></v>He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beer, a soothsayer, who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of Ammon, to call him, and to say: Behold a people is come out of Egypt, that hath covered the face of the earth, sitting over against me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.6"><v id="6"></v>Come therefore, and curse this people, because it is mightier than I: if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land: for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed, and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.7"><v id="7"></v>And the ancients of Moab, and the elders of Madian, went with the price of divination in their hands. And when they were come to Balaam, and had told him all the words of Balac: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.8"><v id="8"></v>He answered: Tarry here this night, and I will answer whatsoever the Lord shall say to me. And while they stayed with Balaam, God came and said to him: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.9"><v id="9"></v>What mean these men that are with thee? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.10"><v id="10"></v>He answered: Balac the son of Sephor king of the Moabites hath sent to me, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.11"><v id="11"></v>Saying: Behold a people that is come out of Egypt, hath covered the face of the land: come and curse them, if by any means I may fight with them and drive them away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.12"><v id="12"></v>And God said to Balaam : Thou shalt not go with them, nor shalt thou curse the people: because it is blessed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.13"><v id="13"></v>And he rose in the morning and said to the princes: Go into your country, because the Lord hath forbid me to come with you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.14"><v id="14"></v>The princes returning, said to Balac: Balaam would not come with us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.15"><v id="15"></v>Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.16"><v id="16"></v>Who, when they were come to Balaam, said: Thus saith Balac the son of Sephor, Delay not to come to me: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.17"><v id="17"></v>For I am ready to honour thee, and will give thee whatsoever thou wilt: come and curse this people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.18"><v id="18"></v>Balaam answered: If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot alter the word of the Lord my God, to speak either more or less. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.19"><v id="19"></v>I pray you to stay here this night also, that I may know what the Lord will answer me once more. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.20"><v id="20"></v>God therefore came to Balaam in the night, and said to him: It these men be come to call thee, arise and go with them: yet so, that thou do what I shall command thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.21"><v id="21"></v>Balaam arose in the morning, and saddling his ass went with them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.22"><v id="22"></v>And God was angry. And an angel of the Lord stood in the way against Balaam, who sat on the ass, and had two servants with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.23"><v id="23"></v>The ass seeing the angel standing in the way, with a drawn sword, turned herself out of the way, and went into the field. And when Balaam beat her, and had a mind to bring her again to the way, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.24"><v id="24"></v>The angel stood in a narrow place between two walls, wherewith the vineyards were enclosed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.25"><v id="25"></v>And the ass seeing him, thrust herself close to the wall, and bruised the foot of the rider. But he beat her again: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.26"><v id="26"></v>And nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place, where there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left, stood to meet him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.27"><v id="27"></v>And when the ass saw the angel standing, she fell under the feet of the rider: who being angry beat her sides more vehemently with a staff. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.28"><v id="28"></v>And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said: What have I done to thee? Why strikest thou me, lo, now this third time? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.29"><v id="29"></v>Balaam answered: Because thou hast deserved it, and hast served me ill: I would I had a sword that I might kill thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.30"><v id="30"></v>The ass said: Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast been always accustomed to ride until this present day? tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee. But he said: Never. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.31"><v id="31"></v>Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword, and he worshipped him falling flat on the ground. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.32"><v id="32"></v>And the angel said to him: Why beatest thou thy ass these three times? I am come to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse, and contrary to me: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.33"><v id="33"></v>And unless the ass had turned out of the way, giving place to me who stood against thee, I had slain thee, and she should have lived. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.34"><v id="34"></v>Balaam said: I have sinned, not knowing that thou didst stand against me: and now if it displease thee that I go, I will return. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.35"><v id="35"></v>The angel said: Go with these men, and see thou speak no other thing than what I shall command thee. He went therefore with the princes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.36"><v id="36"></v>And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of the Moabites, that is situate in the uttermost borders of Arnon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.37"><v id="37"></v>And he said to Balaam: I sent messengers to call thee, why didst thou not come immediately to me? was it because I am not able to reward thy coming? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.38"><v id="38"></v>He answered him: Lo, here I am: shall I have power to speak any other thing but that which God shall put in my mouth? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.39"><v id="39"></v>So they went on together, and came into a city, that was in the uttermost borders of his kingdom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.40"><v id="40"></v>And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep, he sent presents to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.22.41"><v id="41"></v>And when morning was come, he brought him to the high places of Baal, and he beheld the uttermost part of the people. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.23.8"><v id="8"></v>How shall I curse him, whom God hath not cursed? By what means should I detest him, whom the Lord detesteth not? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="4.23.9"><v id="9"></v>I shall see him from the tops of the rocks, and shall consider him from the hills. This people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="4.24.3"><v id="3"></v>He took up his parable and said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man hath said, whose eye ire stopped up: </bcv></p0>
