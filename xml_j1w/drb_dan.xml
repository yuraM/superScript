<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.1"><v id="1"></v>In the third year of the reign of Joakim king of Juda, Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and besieged it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.2"><v id="2"></v>And the Lord delivered into his hands Joakim the king of Juda, and part of the vessels of the house of God: and he carried them away into the land of Sennaar, to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure house of his god. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.3"><v id="3"></v>And the king spoke to Asphenez the master of the eunuchs, that he should bring in some of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed and of the princes, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.4"><v id="4"></v>Children in whom there was no blemish, well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, acute in knowledge, and instructed in science, and such as might stand in the king's palace, that he might teach them the learning, and the tongue of the Chaldeans. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.5"><v id="5"></v>And the king appointed them a daily provision, of his own meat, and of the wine of which he drank himself, that being nourished three years, afterwards they might stand before the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.6"><v id="6"></v>Now there were among them of the children of Juda, Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.7"><v id="7"></v>And the master of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel, Baltassar: to Ananias, Sidrach: to Misael, Misach: and to Azarias, Abdenago. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.8"><v id="8"></v>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not be defiled with the king's table, nor with the wine which he drank: and he requested the master of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.9"><v id="9"></v>And God gave to Daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.10"><v id="10"></v>And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel: I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed you meat and drink: who if he should see your faces leaner than those of the other youths your equals, you shall endanger my head to the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.11"><v id="11"></v>And Daniel said to Malasar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.12"><v id="12"></v>Try, I beseech thee, thy servants for ten days, and let pulse be given us to eat, and water to drink: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.13"><v id="13"></v>And look upon our faces, and the faces of the children that eat of the king's meat: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.14"><v id="14"></v>And when he had heard these words, he tried them for ten days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.15"><v id="15"></v>And after ten days their faces appeared fairer and fatter than all the children that ate of the king's meat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.16"><v id="16"></v>So Malasar took their portions, and the wine that they should drink: and he gave them pulse. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.17"><v id="17"></v>And to these children God gave knowledge, and understanding in every book, and wisdom: but to Daniel the understanding also of all visions and dreams. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.18"><v id="18"></v>And when the days were ended, after which the king had ordered they should be brought in: the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nabuchodonosor. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.19"><v id="19"></v>And when the king had spoken to them, there were not found among them all such as Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias: and they stood in the king's presence. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.20"><v id="20"></v>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the diviners, and wise men, that were in all his kingdom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.1.21"><v id="21"></v>And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.1"><v id="1"></v>In the second year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, Nabuchodonosor had a dream, and his spirit was terrified, and his dream went out of his mind. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.2"><v id="2"></v>Then the king commanded to call together the diviners and the wise men, and the magicians, and the Chaldeans: to declare to the king his dreams: so they came and stood before the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And the king said to them: I saw a dream: and being troubled in mind I know not what I saw. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.4"><v id="4"></v>And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac: O king, live for ever: tell to thy servants thy dream, and we will declare the interpretation thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.5"><v id="5"></v>And the king answering said to the Chaldeans: The thing is gone out of my mind: unless you tell me the dream, and the meaning thereof, you shall be put to death, and your houses shall be confiscated. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.6"><v id="6"></v>But if you tell the dream, and the meaning of it, you shall receive of me rewards, and gifts, and great honour: therefore tell me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.7"><v id="7"></v>They answered again and said: Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation of it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.8"><v id="8"></v>The king answered, and said: I know for certain that you seek to gain time, since you know that the thing is gone from me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.9"><v id="9"></v>If therefore you tell me not the dream, there is one sentence concerning you, that you have also framed a lying interpretation, and full of deceit, to speak before me till the time pass away. Tell me therefore the dream, that I may know that you also give a true interpretation thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.10"><v id="10"></v>Then the Chaldeains answered before the king, and said: There is no man upon earth, that can accomplish thy word, O king, neither doth any king, though great and mighty, ask such a thing of any diviner, or wise man, or Chaldean. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.11"><v id="11"></v>For the thing that thou askest, O king, is difficult; nor can any one be found that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.12"><v id="12"></v>Upon hearing this, the king in fury, and in great wrath, commanded that all the wise men of Babylon should be put to death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.13"><v id="13"></v>And the decree being gone forth, the wise men were slain: and Daniel and his companions were sought for, to be put to death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.14"><v id="14"></v>Then Daniel inquired concerning the law and the sentence, of Arioch the general of the king's army, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.15"><v id="15"></v>And he asked him that had received the orders of the king, why so cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king. And when Arioch had told the matter to Daniel, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.16"><v id="16"></v>Daniel went in and desired of the king, that he would give him time to resolve the question and declare it to the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.17"><v id="17"></v>And he went into his house, and told the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias his companions: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.18"><v id="18"></v>To the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the God of heaven concerning this secret, and that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.19"><v id="19"></v>Then was the mystery revealed to Daniel by a vision in the night: and Daniel blessed the God of heaven, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.20"><v id="20"></v>And speaking he said: Blessed be the name of the Lord from eternity and for evermore: for wisdom and fortitude are his. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.21"><v id="21"></v>And he changeth times and ages: taketh away kingdoms and establisheth them, giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.22"><v id="22"></v>He revealeth deep and hidden things, and knoweth what is in darkness: and light is with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.23"><v id="23"></v>To thee, O God of our fathers, I give thanks, and I praise thee: because thou hast given me wisdom and strength: and now thou hast shewn me what we desired of thee, for thou hast made known to us, the king's discourse. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.24"><v id="24"></v>After this Daniel went in to Arioch, to whom the king had given orders to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he spoke thus to him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will tell the solution to the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.25"><v id="25"></v>Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king, and said to him: I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Juda, that will resolve the question to the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.26"><v id="26"></v>The king answered, and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltassar: Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw, and the interpretation thereof? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.27"><v id="27"></v>And Daniel made answer before the king, and said: The secret that the king desireth to know, none of the wise men, or the philosophers, or the diviners, or the soothsayers can declare to the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.28"><v id="28"></v>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries, who hath shewn to thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, what is to come to pass in the latter times. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.29"><v id="29"></v>Thou, O king, didst begin to think in thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what shall come to pass. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.30"><v id="30"></v>To me also this secret is revealed, not by any wisdom that I have more than all men alive: but that the interpretation might be made manifest to the king, and thou mightest know the thoughts of thy mind. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.31"><v id="31"></v>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was as it were a great statue: this statue, which was great and high, tall of stature, stood before thee, and the look thereof was terrible. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.32"><v id="32"></v>The head of this statue was of fine gold, but the breast and the arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.33"><v id="33"></v>And the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of clay. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.34"><v id="34"></v>Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands: and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and of clay, and broke them in pieces. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.35"><v id="35"></v>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of a summer's thrashingfloor, and they were carried away by the wind: and there was no place found for them: but the stone that struck the statue, became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.36"><v id="36"></v>This is the dream: we will also tell the interpretation thereof before thee, O king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.37"><v id="37"></v>Thou art a king of kings: and the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, and strength, and power, and glory: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.38"><v id="38"></v>And all places wherein the children of men, and the beasts of the field do dwell: he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand, and hath put all things under thy power: thou therefore art the head of gold. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.39"><v id="39"></v>And after thee shall rise up another kingdom, inferior to thee, of silver: and another third kingdom of brass, which shall rule over all the world. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.40"><v id="40"></v>And the fourth kingdom shall be as iron. As iron breaketh into pieces, and subdueth all things, so shall that break and destroy all these. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.41"><v id="41"></v>Arid whereas thou sawest the feet, and the toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron: the kingdom shall be divided, but yet it shall take its origin from the iron, according as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.42"><v id="42"></v>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.43"><v id="43"></v>And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall be mingled indeed together with the seed of man, but they shall not stick fast one to another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.44"><v id="44"></v>But in the days of those kingdoms the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, and his kingdom shall not be delivered up to another people, and it shall break in pieces, and shall consume all these kingdoms, and itself shall stand for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.45"><v id="45"></v>According as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and broke in pieces, the clay, and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, the great God hath shewn the king what shall come to pass hereafter, and the dream is true, and the interpretation thereof is faithful. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.46"><v id="46"></v>Then king Nabuchodonosor fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and incense. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.47"><v id="47"></v>And the king spoke to Daniel, and said: Verily your God is the God of gods, and Lord of kings, and a revealer of hidden things: seeing thou couldst discover this secret. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.48"><v id="48"></v>Then the king advanced Daniel to a high station, and gave him many and great gifts: and he made him governor over all the provinces of Babylon, and chief of the magistrates over all the wise men of Babylon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.2.49"><v id="49"></v>And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago over the works of the province of Babylon: but Daniel himself was in the king's palace. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.1"><v id="1"></v>King Nabuchodonosor made a statue of gold, of sixty cubits high, and six cubits broad, and he set it up in the plain of Dura of the province of Babylon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.2"><v id="2"></v>Then Nabuchodonosor the king sent to call together the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains, the rulers, and governors, and all the chief men of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.3"><v id="3"></v>Then the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains, and rulers, and the great men that were placed in authority, and all the princes of the provinces, were gathered together to come to the dedication of the statue, which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. And they stood before the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.4"><v id="4"></v>Then a herald cried with a strong voice: To you it is commanded, O nations, tribes, and languages: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.5"><v id="5"></v>That in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and of the flute, and of the harp, of the sackbut, and of the psaltery, and of the symphony, and of all kind of music; ye fall down and adore the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor hath set up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.6"><v id="6"></v>But if any man shall not fall down and adore, he shall the same hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.7"><v id="7"></v>Upon this therefore, at the time when all the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music: all the nations, tribes, and languages fell down and adored the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.8"><v id="8"></v>And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused the Jews, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.9"><v id="9"></v>And said to king Nabuchodonosor: O king, live for ever: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.10"><v id="10"></v>Thou, O king, hast made a decree that every man that shall bear the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music, shall prostrate himself, and adore the golden statue: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.11"><v id="11"></v>And that if any man shall not fall down and adore, he should be cast into a furnace of burning fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.12"><v id="12"></v>Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the works of the province of Babylon, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago: these men, O king, have slighted thy decree: they worship not thy gods, nor do they adore the golden statue which thou hast set up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.13"><v id="13"></v>Then Nabuchodonosor in fury, and in wrath, commanded that Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago should be brought: who immediately were brought before the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.14"><v id="14"></v>And Nabuchodonosor the king spoke to them, and said: Is it true, O Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, that you do not worship my gods, nor adore the golden statue that I have set up? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.15"><v id="15"></v>Now therefore if you be ready at what hour soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, harp, sackbut, and psaltery, and symphony, and of all kind of music, prostrate yourselves, and adore the statue which I have made: but if you do not adore, you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.16"><v id="16"></v>Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago answered and said to king Nabuchodonosor: We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this matter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.17"><v id="17"></v>For behold our God, whom we worship, is able to save us from the furnace of burning fire, and to deliver us out of thy hands, O king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.18"><v id="18"></v>But if he will not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not worship thy gods, nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.19"><v id="19"></v>Then was Nabuchodonosor filled with fury: and the countenance of his face was changed against Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it had been accustomed to be heated. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.20"><v id="20"></v>And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army, to bind the feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.21"><v id="21"></v>And immediately these men were bound and were cast into the furnace of burning fire, with their coats, and their caps, and their shoes, and their garments. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.22"><v id="22"></v>For the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace was heated exceedingly. And the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.23"><v id="23"></v>But these three men, that is, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.24"><v id="24"></v>Then Nabuchodonosor the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and said to his nobles: Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered the king, and said: True, O king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.25"><v id="25"></v>He answered, and said: Behold I see four men loose, and walking in the midst of the fire, and there is no hurt in them, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.26"><v id="26"></v>Then Nabuchodonosor came to the door of the burning fiery furnace, and said: Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, ye servants of the most high God, go ye forth, and come. And immediately Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago went out from the midst of the fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.27"><v id="27"></v>And the nobles, and the magistrates, and the judges, and the great men of the king being gathered together, considered these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, and that not a hair of their head had been singed, nor their garments altered, nor the smell of the fire had passed on them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.28"><v id="28"></v>Then Nabuchodonosor breaking forth, said: Blessed be the God of them, to wit, of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that believed in him: and they changed the king's word, and delivered up their bodies that they might not serve, nor adore any god, except their own God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.29"><v id="29"></v>By me therefore this decree is made, that every people, tribe, and tongue, which shall speak blasphemy against the God of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, shall be destroyed, and their houses laid waste: for there is no other God that can save in this manner. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.3.30"><v id="30"></v>Then the king promoted Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, in the province of Babylon. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.9"><v id="9"></v>Baltassar, prince of the diviners, because I know that thou hast in thee the spirit of the holy gods, and that no secret is impossible to thee: tell me the visions of my dreams that I have seen, and the interpretation of them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.10"><v id="10"></v>This was the vision of my head in my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was exceeding great. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.11"><v id="11"></v>The tree was great, and strong: and the height thereof reached unto heaven: the sight thereof was even to the ends of all the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.12"><v id="12"></v>Its leaves were most beautiful, and its fruit exceeding much: and in it was food for all: under it dwelt cattle, and beasts, and in the branches thereof the fowls of the air had their abode: and all flesh did eat of it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.13"><v id="13"></v>I saw in the vision of my head upon my bed, and behold a watcher, and a holy one came down from heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.14"><v id="14"></v>He cried aloud, and said thus: Cut down the tree, and chop off the branches thereof: shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruits: let the beasts fly away that are under it, and the birds from its branches. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.15"><v id="15"></v>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and let it be tied with a band of iron, and of brass, among the grass, that is without, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the wild beasts in the grass of the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.16"><v id="16"></v>Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given him; and let seven times pass over him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.17"><v id="17"></v>This is the decree by the sentence of the watchers, and the word And demand of the holy ones; till the living know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men; and he will give it to whomsoever it shall please him, and he will appoint the basest man over it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.18"><v id="18"></v>I king Nabuchodonosor saw this dream: thou, therefore, O Baltassar, tell me quickly the interpretation: for all the wise men of my kingdom axe not able to declare the meaning of it to me: but thou art able, because the spirit of the holy gods is in thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.19"><v id="19"></v>Then Daniel, whose name was Baltassar, began silently to think within himself for about one hour: and his thoughts troubled him. But the king answering, said: Baltassar, let not the dream and the interpretation thereof trouble thee. Baltassar answered, and said: My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thy enemies. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.20"><v id="20"></v>The tree which thou sawest which was high and strong, whose height reached to the skies, and the sight thereof into all tire earth: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.21"><v id="21"></v>And the branches thereof were most beautiful, and its fruit exceeding much, and in it was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and the birds of the air had their abode in its branches. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.22"><v id="22"></v>It is thou, O king, who art grown great and become mighty: for thy greatness hath grown, and hath reached to heaven, and thy power unto the ends of the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.23"><v id="23"></v>And whereas the king saw a watcher, and a holy one come down from heaven, and say: Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, and let it be bound with iron and brass among the grass without, and let it be sprinkled with the dew of heaven, and let his feeding be with the wild beasts, till seven times pass over him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.24"><v id="24"></v>This is the interpretation of the sentence of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.25"><v id="25"></v>They shall cast thee out from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with cattle and with wild beasts, and thou shalt eat grass as an ox, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven: and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.26"><v id="26"></v>But whereas he commanded, that the stump of the roots thereof, that is, of the tree, should be left: thy kingdom shall remain to thee after thou shalt have known that power is from heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.27"><v id="27"></v>Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and redeem thou thy sins with alms, and thy iniquities with works of mercy to the poor: perhaps he will forgive thy offences. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.28"><v id="28"></v>All these things came upon king Nabuchodonosor. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.29"><v id="29"></v>At the end of twelve months he was walking in the palace of Babylon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.30"><v id="30"></v>And the king answered, and said: Is not this the great Babylon, which I have built to be the seat of the kingdom, by the strength of my power, and in the glory of my excellence? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.31"><v id="31"></v>And while the word was yet in the king's mouth, a voice came down from heaven: To thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, it is said: Thy kingdom shall pass from thee, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.32"><v id="32"></v>And they shall cast thee out from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with cattle and wild beasts: thou shalt eat grass like an ox, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.33"><v id="33"></v>The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nabuchodonosor, and he was driven away from among men, and did eat grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven: till his hairs grew like the feathers of eagles, and his nails like birds' claws. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.34"><v id="34"></v>Now at the end of the days, I Nabuchodonosor lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my sense was restored to me: and I blessed the most High, and I praised and glorified him that liveth for ever: for his power is an everlasting power, and his kingdom is to all generations. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.35"><v id="35"></v>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before him: for he doth according to his will, as well with the powers of heaven, as among the inhabitants of the earth: and there is none that can resist his hand, and say to him: Why hast thou done it? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.36"><v id="36"></v>At the same time my sense returned to me, and I came to the honour and glory of my kingdom: and my shape returned to me: and my nobles, and my magistrates sought for me, and I was restored to my kingdom: and greater majesty was added to me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.4.37"><v id="37"></v>Therefore I Nabuchodonosor do now praise, and magnify, and glorify the King of heaven: because all his works are true, and his ways judgments, and them that walk in pride he is able to abase. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.2"><v id="2"></v>And being now drunk he commanded that they should bring the vessels of gold and silver which Nabuchodonosor his father had brought away out of the temple, that was in Jerusalem, that the king and his nobles, and his wives and his concubines, might drink in them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.3"><v id="3"></v>Then were the golden and silver vessels brought, which he had brought away out of the temple that was in Jerusalem: and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines, drank in them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.4"><v id="4"></v>They drank wine, and praised their gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, and of wood, and of stone. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.5"><v id="5"></v>In the same hour there appeared fingers, as it were of the hand of a man, writing over against the candlestick upon the surface of the wall of the king's palace: and the king beheld the joints of the hand that wrote. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.6"><v id="6"></v>Then was the king's countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him: and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees struck one against the other. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.7"><v id="7"></v>And the king cried out aloud to bring in the wise men, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spoke, and said to the wise men of Babylon: Whosoever shall read this writing, and shall make known to me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and shall have a golden chain on his neck, and shall be the third man in my kingdom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.8"><v id="8"></v>Then came in all the king's wise men, but they could neither read the writing, nor declare the interpretation to the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.9"><v id="9"></v>Wherewith king Baltasar was much troubled, and his countenance was changed: and his nobles also were troubled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.10"><v id="10"></v>Then the queen, on occasion of what had happened to the king, and his nobles, came into the banquet house: and she spoke and said: O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, neither let thy countenance be changed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.11"><v id="11"></v>There is a man in thy kingdom that hath the spirit of the holy gods in him: and in the days of thy father knowledge and wisdom were found in him: for king Nabuchodonosor thy father appointed him prince of the wise men, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers, thy father, I say, O king: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.12"><v id="12"></v>Because a greater spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, and interpretation of dreams, and shewing of secrets, and resolving of difficult things, were found in him, that is, in Daniel: whom the king named Baltarsar. Now therefore let Daniel be called for, and he will tell the interpretation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.13"><v id="13"></v>Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king spoke, and said to him: Art thou Daniel of the children of the captivity of Juda, whom my father the king brought out of Judea? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.14"><v id="14"></v>I have heard of thee, that thou hast the spirit of the gods, and excellent knowledge, and understanding, and wisdom are found in thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.15"><v id="15"></v>And now the wise men the magicians have come in before me, to read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof: and they could not declare to me the meaning of this writing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.16"><v id="16"></v>But I have heard of thee, that thou canst interpret obscure things, and resolve difficult things: now if thou art able to read the writing, and to shew me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and shalt have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third prince in my kingdom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.17"><v id="17"></v>To which Daniel made answer, and said before the king: Thy rewards be to thyself, and the gifts of thy house give to another: but the writing I will read to thee, O king, and shew thee the interpretation thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.18"><v id="18"></v>O king, the most high God gave to Nabuchodonosor thy father a kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and honour. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.19"><v id="19"></v>And for the greatness that he gave to him, all people, tribes, and languages trembled, and were afraid of him: whom he would, he slew: and whom he would, he destroyed: and whom he would, he set up: and whom he would, he brought down. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.20"><v id="20"></v>But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit hardened unto pride, he was put down from the throne of his kingdom, and his glory was taken away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.21"><v id="21"></v>And he was driven out from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses, and he did eat grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven: till he knew that the most High ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he will set over it whomsoever it shall please him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.22"><v id="22"></v>Thou also his son, O Baltasar, hast not humbled thy heart, whereas thou knewest all these things: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.23"><v id="23"></v>But hast lifted thyself up against the Lord of heaven: and the vessels of his house have been brought before thee: and thou, and thy nobles, and thy wives, and thy concubines have drunk wine in them: and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and of gold, and of brass, of iron, and of wood, and of stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor feel: but the God who hath thy breath in his hand, and all thy ways, thou hast not glorified. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.24"><v id="24"></v>Wherefore he hath sent the part of the hand which hath written this that is set down. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.25"><v id="25"></v>And this is the writing that is written: MANE, THECEL, PHARES. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.26"><v id="26"></v>And this is the interpretation of the word. MANE: God hath numbered thy kingdom, and hath finished it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.27"><v id="27"></v>THECEL: thou art weighed in the balance, and art found wanting. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.28"><v id="28"></v>PHARES: thy kingdom is divided, and is given to the Medes and Persians. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.29"><v id="29"></v>Then by the king's command Daniel was clothed with purple, and a chain of gold was put about his neck: and it was proclaimed of him that he had power as the third man in the kingdom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.5.30"><v id="30"></v>The same night Baltasar the Chaldean king was slain. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.1"><v id="1"></v>It seemed good to Darius, and he appointed over the kingdom a hundred and twenty governors to be over his whole kingdom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.2"><v id="2"></v>And three princes over them, of whom Daniel was one: that the governors might give an account to them, and the king might have no trouble. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.3"><v id="3"></v>And Daniel excelled all the princes, and governors: because a greater spirit of God was in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.4"><v id="4"></v>And the king thought to set him over all the kingdom: whereupon the princes, and the governors sought to find occasion against Daniel with regard to the king: and they could find no cause, nor suspicion, because he was faithful, and no fault, nor suspicion was found in him </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.5"><v id="5"></v>Then these men said: We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, unless perhaps concerning the law of his God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.6"><v id="6"></v>Then the princes, and the governors craftily suggested to the king, and spoke thus unto him: King Darius, live for ever: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.7"><v id="7"></v>All the princes of the kingdom, the magistrates, and governors, the senators, and judges have consulted together, that an imperial decree, and an edict be published: That whosoever shall ask any petition of any god, or man, for thirty days, but of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.8"><v id="8"></v>Now, therefore, O king, confirm the sentence, and sign the decree: that what is decreed by the Medes and Persians may not be altered, nor any man be allowed to transgress it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.9"><v id="9"></v>So king Darius set forth the decree, and established it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.10"><v id="10"></v>Now when Daniel knew this, that is to say, that the law was made, he went into his house: and opening the windows in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem, he knelt down three times a day, and adored, and gave thanks before his God, as he had been accustomed to do before. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.11"><v id="11"></v>Wherefore those men carefully watching him, found Daniel praying and making supplication to his God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.12"><v id="12"></v>And they came and spoke to the king concerning the edict: O king, hast thou not decreed, that every man that should make a request to any of the gods, or men, for thirty days, but to thyself, O king, should be cast into the den of the lions? And the king answered them, saying: The word is true according to the decree of the Medes and Persians, which it is not lawful to violate. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.13"><v id="13"></v>Then they answered, and said before the king: Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Juda, hath not regarded thy law, nor the decree that thou hast made: but three times a day he maketh his prayer. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.14"><v id="14"></v>Now when the king had heard these words, he was very much grieved, and in behalf of Daniel he set his heart to deliver him and even till sunset he laboured to save him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.15"><v id="15"></v>But those mer. perceiving the king's design, said to him: Know thou, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree which the king hath made, may be altered. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.16"><v id="16"></v>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of the lions. And the king said to Daniel: Thy God, whom thou always servest, he will deliver thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.17"><v id="17"></v>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den: which the king sealed with his own ring, and with the ring of his nobles, that nothing should be done against Daniel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.18"><v id="18"></v>And the king went away to his house and laid himself down without taking supper, and meat was not set before him, and even sleep departed from him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.19"><v id="19"></v>Then the king rising very early in the morning, went in haste to the lions' den: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.20"><v id="20"></v>And coming near to the den, cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel, and said to him: Daniel, servant of the living God, hath thy God, whom thou servest always, been able, thinkest thou, to deliver thee from the lions? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.21"><v id="21"></v>And Daniel answering the king, said: O king, live for ever: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.22"><v id="22"></v>My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut up the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him justice hath been found in me: yea and before thee, O king, I have done no offence. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.23"><v id="23"></v>Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and he commanded that Daniel should be taken out of the den: and Daniel was taken out of the den, and no hurt was found in him, because he believed in his God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.24"><v id="24"></v>And by the king's commandment, those men were brought that bad accused Daniel: and they were cast into the lions' den, they and their children, and their wives: and they did not reach the bottom of the den, before the lions caught them, and broke all their bones in pieces. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.25"><v id="25"></v>Then king Darius wrote to all people, tribes, and languages, dwelling in the whole earth: PEACE be multiplied unto you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.26"><v id="26"></v>It is decreed by me, that in all my empire and my kingdom all men dread and fear the God of Daniel. For he is the living and eternal God for ever: and his kingdom shall not be destroyed, and his power shall be for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.6.27"><v id="27"></v>He is the deliverer, and saviour, doing signs and wonders in heaven, and in earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions' den. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.1"><v id="1"></v>In the first year of Baltasar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream: and the vision of his head was upon his bed: and writing the dream, he comprehended it in few words: and relating the sum of it in short, he said: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.2"><v id="2"></v>I saw in my vision by night, and behold the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.3"><v id="3"></v>And four great beasts, different one from another, came up out of the sea. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.4"><v id="4"></v>The first was like a lioness, and had the wings of an eagle: I beheld till her wings were plucked off, and she was lifted up from the earth, and stood upon her feet as a man, and the heart of a man was given to her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.5"><v id="5"></v>And behold another beast like a bear stood up on one side: and there were three rows in the mouth thereof, and in the teeth thereof, and thus they said to it: Arise, devour much flesh. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.6"><v id="6"></v>After this I beheld, and lo, another like a leopard, and it had upon it four wings as of a fowl, and the beast had four heads, and power was given to it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.7"><v id="7"></v>After this I beheld in the vision of the night, and lo, a fourth beast, terrible and wonderful, and exceeding strong, it had great iron teeth, eating and breaking in pieces, and treading down the rest with its feet: and it was unlike to the other beasts which I had seen before it, and had ten horns. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.8"><v id="8"></v>I considered the horns, and behold another little horn sprung out of the midst of them: and three of the first horns were plucked up at the presence thereof: and behold eyes like the eyes of a man were in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.9"><v id="9"></v>I beheld till thrones were placed, and the Ancient of days sat: his garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like clean wool: his throne like flames of fire: the wheels of it like a burning fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.10"><v id="10"></v>A swift stream of fire issued forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before him: the judgment sat, and the books were opened. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.11"><v id="11"></v>I beheld because of the voice of the great words which that horn spoke: and I saw that the beast was slain, and the body thereof was destroyed, and given to the fire to be burnt: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.12"><v id="12"></v>And that the power of the other beasts was taken away: and that times of life were appointed them for a time, and time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.13"><v id="13"></v>I beheld therefore in the vision of the night, and lo, one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and he came even to the Ancient of days: and they presented him before him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.14"><v id="14"></v>And he gave him power, and glory, and a kingdom: and all peoples, tribes and tongues shall serve him: his power is an everlasting power that shall not be taken away: and his kingdom that shall not be destroyed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.15"><v id="15"></v>My spirit trembled, I Daniel was affrighted at these things, and the visions of my head troubled me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.16"><v id="16"></v>I went near to one of them that stood by, and asked the truth of him concerning all these things, and he told me the interpretation of the words, and instructed me: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.17"><v id="17"></v>These four great beasts are four kingdoms, which shall arise out of the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.18"><v id="18"></v>But the saints of the most high God shall take the kingdom: and they shall possess the kingdom for ever and ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.19"><v id="19"></v>After this I would diligently learn concerning the fourth beast. which was very different from all, and exceeding terrible: his teeth and claws were of iron: he devoured and broke in pieces, and the rest he stamped upon with his feet: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.20"><v id="20"></v>And concerning the ten horns that he had on his head: and concerning the other that came up, before which three horns fell: and of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and was greater than the rest. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.21"><v id="21"></v>I beheld, and lo, that horn made war against the saints, and prevailed over them, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.22"><v id="22"></v>Till the Ancient of days came and gave judgment to the saints of the most High, and the time came, and the saints obtained the kingdom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.23"><v id="23"></v>And thus he said: The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be greater than all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.24"><v id="24"></v>And the ten horns of the same kingdom, shall be ten kings: and another shall rise up after them, and he shall be mightier than the former, and he shall bring down three kings. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.25"><v id="25"></v>And he shall speak words against the High One, and shall crush the saints of the most High: and he shall think himself able to change times and laws, and they shall be delivered into his hand until a time, and times, and half a time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.26"><v id="26"></v>And judgment shall sit, that his power may be taken away, and be broken in pieces, and perish even to the end. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.27"><v id="27"></v>And that the kingdom, and power, and the greatness of the kingdom, under the whole heaven, may be given to the people of the saints of the most High: whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all kings shall serve him, and shall obey him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.7.28"><v id="28"></v>Hitherto is the end of the word. I Daniel was much troubled with my thoughts, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the word in my heart. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.1"><v id="1"></v>In the third year of the reign of king Baltasar, a vision appeared to me. I Daniel, after what I had seen in the beginning, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.2"><v id="2"></v>Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa, which is in the province of Elam: and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of Ulai. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.3"><v id="3"></v>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold a ram stood before the water, having two high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up. Afterward </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.4"><v id="4"></v>I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own will, and became great. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.5"><v id="5"></v>And I understood: and behold a he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and he touched not the ground, and the he goat had a notable horn between his eyes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.6"><v id="6"></v>And he went up to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing before the gate, and he ran towards him in the force of his strength. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.7"><v id="7"></v>And when he was come near the ram, he was enraged against him, and struck the ram: and broke his two horns, and the ram could not withstand him: and when he had cast him down on the ground, he stamped upon him, and none could deliver the ram out of his hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.8"><v id="8"></v>And the he goat became exceeding great: and when he was grown, the great horn was broken, and there came up four horns under it towards the four winds of heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.9"><v id="9"></v>And out of one of them came forth a little horn: and it became great against the south, and against the east, and against the strength. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.10"><v id="10"></v>And it was magnified even unto the strength of heaven: and it threw down of the strength, and of the stars, and trod upon them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.11"><v id="11"></v>And it was magnified even to the prince of the strength: and it took away from him the continual sacrifice, and cast down the place of his sanctuary. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.12"><v id="12"></v>And strength was given him against the continual sacrifice, because of sins: and truth shall be cast down on the ground, and he shall do and shall prosper. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.13"><v id="13"></v>And I heard one of the saints speaking, and one saint said to another, I know not to whom that was speaking: How long shall be the vision, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of the desolation that is made: and the sanctuary, and the strength be trodden under foot? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.14"><v id="14"></v>And he said to him: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days: and the sanctuary shall be cleansed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.15"><v id="15"></v>And it came to pass when I Daniel saw the vision, and sought the meaning, that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of a man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.16"><v id="16"></v>And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai: and he called, and said: Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.17"><v id="17"></v>And he came and stood near where I stood: and when he was come, I fell on my face trembling, and he said to me: Understand, O son of man, for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.18"><v id="18"></v>And when he spoke to me I fell flat on the ground: and he touched me, and set me upright, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.19"><v id="19"></v>And he said to me: I will shew thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the malediction: for the time hath its end. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.20"><v id="20"></v>The ram, which thou sawest with horns, is the king of the Medes and Persians. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.21"><v id="21"></v>And the he goat, is the king of the Greeks, and the great horn that was between his eyes, the same is the first king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.22"><v id="22"></v>But whereas when that was broken, there arose up four for it: four kings shall rise up of his nation, but not with his strength. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.23"><v id="23"></v>And after their reign, when iniquities shall be grown up, there shall arise a king of a shameless face, and understanding dark sentences. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.24"><v id="24"></v>And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own force: and he shall lay all things waste, and shall prosper, and do more than can be believed. And he shall destroy the mighty, and the people of the saints, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.25"><v id="25"></v>According to his will, and craft shall be successful in his hand: and his heart shall be puffed up, and in the abundance of all things he shall kill many: and he shall rise up against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.26"><v id="26"></v>And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told, is true: thou therefore seal up the vision, because it shall come to pass after many days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.8.27"><v id="27"></v>And I Daniel languished, and was sick for some days: and when I was risen up, I did the king's business, and I was astonished at the vision, and there was none that could interpret it. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.9.4"><v id="4"></v>And I prayed to the Lord my God, and I made my confession, and said: I beseech thee, O Lord God, great and terrible, who keepest the covenant, and mercy to them that love thee, and keep thy commandments. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.9.5"><v id="5"></v>We have sinned, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly, and have revolted: and we have gone aside from thv commandments, and thy judgments. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.9.8"><v id="8"></v>O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our princes, and to our fathers that have sinned. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.9.12"><v id="12"></v>And he hath confirmed his words which he spoke against us, and against our princes that judged us, that he would bring in upon us a great evil, such as never was under all the heaven, according to that which hath been done in Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.9.19"><v id="19"></v>O Lord, hear: O Lord, be appeased: hearken and do: delay not for thy own sake, O my God: because thy name is invocated upon thy city, and upon thy people. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.10.2"><v id="2"></v>In those days I Daniel mourned the days of three weeks. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.10.3"><v id="3"></v>I ate no desirable bread, and neither flesh, nor wine entered into my mouth, neither was I anointed with ointment: till the days of three weeks were accomplished. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.10.5"><v id="5"></v>And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw: and behold a man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with the finest gold: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.10.12"><v id="12"></v>And he said to me: Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, to afflict thyself in the sight of thy God, thy words have been heard: and I am come for thy words. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.10.13"><v id="13"></v>But the prince of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one and twenty days: and behold Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there by the king of the Persians. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.22"><v id="22"></v>And the arms of the fighter shall be overcome before his face, and shall be broken; yea also the prince of the covenant. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.23"><v id="23"></v>And after friendships, he will deal deceitfully with him: and he shall go up, and shall overcome with a small people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.24"><v id="24"></v>And he shall enter into rich and plentiful cities: and he shall do that which his fathers never did, nor his fathers' fathers: he shall scatter their spoils, and their prey, and their riches, and shall forecast devices against the best fenced places: and this until a time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.25"><v id="25"></v>And his strength and his heart shall be stirred up against the king of the south with a great army: and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with many and very strong succours: and they shall not stand, for they shall form designs against him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.26"><v id="26"></v>And they that eat bread with him, shall destroy him, and his army shall be overthrown: and many shall fall down slain. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.27"><v id="27"></v>And the heart of the two kings shall be to do evil, and they shall speak lies at one table, and they shall not prosper: because as yet the end is unto another time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.28"><v id="28"></v>And he shall return into his land with much riches: and his heart shall be against the holy covenant, and he shall succeed and shall return into his own land. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.29"><v id="29"></v>At the time appointed he shall return, and he shall come to the south, but the latter time shall not be like the former. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.30"><v id="30"></v>And the galleys and the Romans shall come upon him, and he shall be struck, and shall return, and shall have indignation against the covenant of the sanctuary, and he shall succeed: and he shall return and shall devise against them that have forsaken the covenant of the sanctuary. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.31"><v id="31"></v>And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall defile the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the continual sacrifice, and they shall place there the abomination unto desolation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.32"><v id="32"></v>And such as deal wickedly against the covenant shall deceitfully dissemble: but the people that know their God shall prevail and succeed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.33"><v id="33"></v>And they that are learned among the people shall teach many: and they shall fall by the sword, and by fire, and by captivity, and by spoil for many days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.34"><v id="34"></v>And when they shall have fallen they shall be relieved with a small help: and many shall be joined to them deceitfully. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.35"><v id="35"></v>And some of the learned shall fall, that they may be tried, and may be chosen, and made white even to the appointed time, because yet there shall be another time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.36"><v id="36"></v>And the king shall do according to his will, and he shall be lifted up, and shall magnify himself against every god: and he shall speak great things against the God of gods, and shall prosper, till the wrath be accomplished. For the determination is made. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.37"><v id="37"></v>And he shall make no account of the God of his fathers: and he shall follow the lust of women, and he shall not regard any gods: for he shall rise up against all things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.38"><v id="38"></v>But he shall worship the god Maozim in his place: and a god whom his fathers knew not, he shall worship with gold, and silver, and precious stones, and things of great price. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.39"><v id="39"></v>And he shall do this to fortify Maozim with a strange god, whom he hath acknowledged, and he shall increase glory and shall give them power over many, and shall divide the land gratis. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.40"><v id="40"></v>And at the time prefixed the king of the south shall fight against him, and the king of the north shall come against him like a tempest, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with a great navy, and he shall enter into the countries, and shall destroy, and pass through. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.41"><v id="41"></v>And he shall enter into the glorious land, and many shall fall: and these only shall be saved out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the principality of the children of Ammon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.42"><v id="42"></v>And he shall lay his hand upon the lands: and the land of Egypt shall not escape. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.43"><v id="43"></v>And he shall have power over the treasures of gold, and of silver, and all the precious things of Egypt: and he shall pass through Libya, and Ethiopia. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.44"><v id="44"></v>And tidings out of the east, and out of the north shall trouble him: and he shall come with a great multitude to destroy and slay many. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.11.45"><v id="45"></v>And he shall fix his tabernacle Apadno between the seas, upon a glorious and holy mountain: and he shall come even to the top thereof, and none shall help him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.1"><v id="1"></v>Now there was a man that dwelt in Babylon, and his name was Joakim: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.2"><v id="2"></v>And he took a wife whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Helcias, a very beautiful woman, and one that feared God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.3"><v id="3"></v>For her parents being just, had instructed their daughter according to the law of Moses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.4"><v id="4"></v>Now Joakim was very rich, and had an orchard near his house: and the Jews resorted to him, because he was the most honourable of them all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.5"><v id="5"></v>And there were two of the ancients of the people appointed judges that year, of whom the Lord said: Iniquity came out from Babylon from the ancient judges, that seemed to govern the people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.6"><v id="6"></v>These men frequented the house of Joakim, and all that had any matters of judgment came to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.7"><v id="7"></v>And when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went in, and walked in her husband's orchard. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.8"><v id="8"></v>And the old men saw her going in every day, and walking: and they were inflamed with lust towards her: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.9"><v id="9"></v>And they perverted their own mind and turned away their eyes that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.10"><v id="10"></v>So they were both wounded with the love of her, yet they did not make known their grief one to the other: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.11"><v id="11"></v>For they were ashamed to declare to one another their lust, being desirous to have to do with her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.12"><v id="12"></v>And they watched carefully every day to see her. And one said to the other: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.13"><v id="13"></v>Let us now go home, for it is dinner time. So going out they departed one from another. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.14"><v id="14"></v>And turning back again, they came both to the same place: and asking one another the cause, they acknowledged their lust; and then they agreed upon a time, when they might find her alone. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.15"><v id="15"></v>And it fell out, as they watched a fit day, she went in on a time, as yesterday and the day before, with two maids only, and was desirous to wash herself in the orchard: for it was hot weather. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.16"><v id="16"></v>And there was nobody there, but the two old men that had hid themselves and were beholding her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.17"><v id="17"></v>So she said to the maids: Bring me oil, and washing balls, and shut the doors of the orchard, that I may wash me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.18"><v id="18"></v>And they did as she bade them: and they shut the doors of the orchard, and went out by a back door to fetch what she had commanded them, and they knew not that the elders were hid within. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.19"><v id="19"></v>Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders arose, and ran to her, and said: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.20"><v id="20"></v>Behold the doors of the orchard are shut, and nobody seeth us, and we are in love with thee: wherefore consent to us, and lie with us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.21"><v id="21"></v>But if thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that a young man was with thee, and therefore thou didst send away thy maids from thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.22"><v id="22"></v>Susanna sighed, and said: I am straitened on every side: for if I do this thing, it is death to me: and if I do it not, I shall not escape your hands. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.23"><v id="23"></v>But it is better for me to fall into your hands without doing it, than to sin in the sight of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.24"><v id="24"></v>With that Susanna cried out with a loud voice: and the elders also cried out against her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.25"><v id="25"></v>And one of them ran to the door of the orchard, and opened it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.26"><v id="26"></v>So when the servants of the house heard the cry in the orchard, they rushed in by the back door to see what was the matter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.27"><v id="27"></v>But after the old men had spoken, the servants were greatly ashamed: for never had there been any such word said of Susanna. And on the next day, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.28"><v id="28"></v>When the people were come to Joakim her husband, the two elders also came full of wicked device against Susanna, to put her to death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.29"><v id="29"></v>And they said before the people: Send to Susanna daughter of Helcias the wife of Joakim. And presently they sent. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.30"><v id="30"></v>And she came with her parents, and children, and all her kindred. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.31"><v id="31"></v>Now Susanna was exceeding delicate, and beautiful to behold. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.32"><v id="32"></v>But those wicked men commanded that her face should be uncovered, (for she was covered,) that so at least they might be satisfied with her beauty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.33"><v id="33"></v>Therefore her friends and all her acquaintance wept. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.34"><v id="34"></v>But the two elders rising up in the midst of the people, laid their hands upon her head. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.35"><v id="35"></v>And she weeping looked up to heaven, for her heart had confidence in the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.36"><v id="36"></v>And the elders said: As we walked in the orchard alone, this woman came in with two maids, and shut the doors of the orchard, and sent away the maids from her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.37"><v id="37"></v>Then a young man that was there hid came to her, and lay with her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.38"><v id="38"></v>But we that were in a corner of the orchard, seeing this wickedness, ran up to them, and we saw them lie together. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.39"><v id="39"></v>And him indeed we could not take, because he was stronger than us, and opening the doors be leaped out: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.40"><v id="40"></v>But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us: of this thing we are witnesses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.41"><v id="41"></v>The multitude believed them as being the elders and the judges of the people, and they condemned her to death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.42"><v id="42"></v>Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said: O eternal God, who knowest hidden things, who knowest all things before they come to pass, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.43"><v id="43"></v>Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me: and behold I must die, whereas I have done none of these things, which these men have maliciously forged against me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.44"><v id="44"></v>And the Lord heard her voice. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.45"><v id="45"></v>And when she was led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young boy, whose name was Daniel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.46"><v id="46"></v>And he cried out with a loud voice I am clear from the blood of this woman. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.47"><v id="47"></v>Then all the people turning themselves towards him, said: What meaneth this word that thou hast spoken? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.48"><v id="48"></v>But he standing in the midst of them, said: Are ye so foolish, ye children of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the truth, you have condemned a daughter of Israel? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.49"><v id="49"></v>Return to judgment, for they have borne false witness against her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.50"><v id="50"></v>So all the people turned again in haste, and the old men said to him: Come, and sit thou down among us, and shew it as: seeing God hath given thee the honour of old age. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.51"><v id="51"></v>And Daniel said to the people: Separate these two far from one another, and I will examine them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.52"><v id="52"></v>So when they were put asunder one from the other, he called one of them, and said to him: O thou that art grown old in evil days, now are thy sins come out, which thou hast committed before: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.53"><v id="53"></v>In judging unjust judgments, oppressing the innocent, and letting the guilty to go free, whereas the Lord saith: The innocent and the just thou shalt not kill. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.54"><v id="54"></v>Now then, if thou sawest her, tell me under what tree thou sawest them conversing together. He said: Under a mastic tree. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.55"><v id="55"></v>And Daniel said: Well hast thou lied against thy own head: for behold the angel of God having received the sentence of him, shall cut thee in two. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.56"><v id="56"></v>And having put him aside, he commanded that the other should come, and he said to him: O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hath deceived thee, and lust hath perverted thy heart: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.57"><v id="57"></v>Thus did you do to the daughters of Israel, and they for fear conversed with you: but a daughter of Juda would not abide your wickedness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.58"><v id="58"></v>Now therefore tell me, under what tree didst thou take them conversing together., And he answered: Under a holm tree. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.59"><v id="59"></v>And Daniel said to him: Well hast thou also lied against thy own head: for the angel of the Lord waiteth with a sword to cut thee in two, and to destroy you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.60"><v id="60"></v>With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and they blessed God, who saveth them that trust in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.61"><v id="61"></v>And they rose up against the two elders, (for Daniel had convicted them of false witness by their own mouth,) and they did to them as they had maliciously dealt against their neighbour, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.62"><v id="62"></v>To fulfil the law of Moses: and they put them to death, and innocent blood was saved in that day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.63"><v id="63"></v>But Helcias and his wife praised God, for their daughter Susanna, with Joakim her husband, and all her kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.64"><v id="64"></v>And Daniel became great in the sight of the people from that day, and thenceforward. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.13.65"><v id="65"></v>And king Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus the Persian received his kingdom. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.1"><v id="1"></v>And Daniel was the king's guest, and was honoured above all his friends. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.2"><v id="2"></v>Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel: and there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and sixty vessels of wine. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.3"><v id="3"></v>The king also worshipped him, and went every day to adore him: but Daniel adored his God. And the king said to him: Why dost thou not adore Bel? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.4"><v id="4"></v>And he answered, and said to him: Because I do not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, that created heaven and earth, and hath power over all flesh. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.5"><v id="5"></v>And the king said to him: Doth not Bel seem to thee to be a living god? Seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.6"><v id="6"></v>Then Daniel smiled and said: O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, neither hath he eaten at any time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.7"><v id="7"></v>And the king being angry called for his priests, and said to them: If you tell me not, who it is that eateth up these expenses, you shall die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.8"><v id="8"></v>But if you can shew that Bel eateth these things, Daniel shall die, because he hath blasphemed against Bel. And Daniel said to the king: Be it done according to thy word. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.9"><v id="9"></v>Now the priests of Bel were seventy, besides their wives, and little ones, and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.10"><v id="10"></v>And the priests of Bel said: Behold we go out: and do thou, O king, set on the meats, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast, and seal it with thy own ring: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.11"><v id="11"></v>And when thou comest in the morning, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death, or else Daniel that hath lied against us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.12"><v id="12"></v>And they little regarded it, because they had made under the table a secret entrance, and they always came in by it, and consumed those things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.13"><v id="13"></v>So it came to pass after they were gone out, the king set the meats before Bel: and Daniel commanded his servants, and they brought ashes, and he sifted them all over the temple before the king: and going forth they shut the door, and having sealed it with the king's ring, they departed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.14"><v id="14"></v>But the priests went in by night, according to their custom, with their wives and their children: and they ate and drank up all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.15"><v id="15"></v>And the king arose early in the morning, and Daniel with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.16"><v id="16"></v>And the king said: Are the seals whole, Daniel? And he answered: They are whole, O king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.17"><v id="17"></v>And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked upon the table, and cried out with a loud voice: Great art thou, O Bel, and there is not any deceit with thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.18"><v id="18"></v>And Daniel laughed: and he held the king that he should not go in: and he said: Behold the pavement, mark whose footsteps these are. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.19"><v id="19"></v>And the king said: I see the footsteps of men, and women, and children. And the king was angry. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.20"><v id="20"></v>Then he took the priests, and their wives, and their children: and they shewed him the private doors by which they came in, and consumed the things that were on the table. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.21"><v id="21"></v>The king therefore put them to death, and delivered Bel into the power of Daniel: who destroyed him, and his temple. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.22"><v id="22"></v>And there was a great dragon in that place, and the Babylonians worshipped him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.23"><v id="23"></v>And the king said to Daniel: Behold thou canst not say now, that this is not a living god: adore him therefore. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.24"><v id="24"></v>And Daniel said: I adore the Lord my God: for he is the living God: but that is no living god. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.25"><v id="25"></v>But give me leave, O king, and I will kill this dragon without sword or club. And the king said: I give thee leave. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.26"><v id="26"></v>Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and boiled them together: and he made lumps, and put them into the dragon's mouth, and the dragon burst asunder. And he said: Behold him whom you worshipped. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.27"><v id="27"></v>And when the Babylonians had heard this, they took great indignation: and being gathered together against the king, they said: The king is become a Jew. He hath destroyed Bel, he hath killed the dragon, and he hath put the priests to death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.28"><v id="28"></v>And they came to the king, and said: Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thy house. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.29"><v id="29"></v>And the king saw that they pressed upon him violently: and being constrained by necessity he delivered Daniel to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.30"><v id="30"></v>And they cast him into the den of lions, and he was there six days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.31"><v id="31"></v>And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given to them two carcasses every day, and two sheep: but then they were not given unto them, that they might devour Daniel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.32"><v id="32"></v>Now there was in Judea a prophet called Habacuc, and he had boiled pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl: and was going into the field, to carry it to the reapers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.33"><v id="33"></v>And the angel of the Lord said to Habacuc: Carry the dinner which thou hast into Babylon to Daniel, who is in the lions' den. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.34"><v id="34"></v>And Habacuc said: Lord, I never saw Babylon, nor do I know the den. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.35"><v id="35"></v>And the angel of the Lord took him by the top of his head, and carried him by the hair of his head, and set him in Babylon over the den in the force of his spirit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.36"><v id="36"></v>And Habacuc cried, saying: O Daniel, thou servant of God, take the dinner that God hath sent thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.37"><v id="37"></v>And Daniel said: Thou hast remembered me, O God, and thou hast not forsaken them that love thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.38"><v id="38"></v>And Daniel arose and ate. And the angel of the Lord presently set Habacuc again in his own place. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.39"><v id="39"></v>And upon the seventh day the king came to bewail Daniel: and he came to the den, and looked in, and behold Daniel was sitting in the midst of the lions. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.40"><v id="40"></v>And the king cried out with a loud voice, saying: Great art thou, O Lord the God of Daniel. And he drew him out of the lions' den. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.41"><v id="41"></v>But those that bad been the cause of his destruction, he cast into the den, and they were devoured in a moment before him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="27.14.42"><v id="42"></v>Then the king said: Let all the inhabitants of the whole earth fear the God of Daniel: for he is the Saviour, working signs, and wonders in the earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions' den.</bcv></p0>
