<p0><bcv bcv="28.1.2"><v id="2"></v>The beginning of the Lord's speaking by Osse: and the Lord said to Osee: Go, take thee a wife of fornications, and have of her children of fornications: for the land by fornication shall depart from the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="28.1.3"><v id="3"></v>So he went, and took Gomer the daughter of Debelaim: and she conceived and bore him a son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="28.1.4"><v id="4"></v>And the Lord said to him: Call his name Jezrahel: for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezrahel upon the house of Jehu, and I will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="28.1.5"><v id="5"></v>And in that day I will break in pieces the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrahel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="28.1.6"><v id="6"></v>And she conceived again, and bore a daughter, and he said to him: Call her name, Without mercy: for I will not add any more to have mercy on the house of Israel, but I will utterly forget them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="28.1.7"><v id="7"></v>And I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and I will save them by the Lord their God: and Iwill not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="28.1.8"><v id="8"></v>And she weaned her that was called Without mercy. And she conceived, and bore a son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="28.1.9"><v id="9"></v>And he said: Call his name, Not my people: for you are not my people, and I will not be yours. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="28.1.10"><v id="10"></v>And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, that is without measure, and shall not be numbered. And it shall be in the place where it shall be said to them: You are not my people: it shall be said to them: Ye are the sons of the living God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="28.1.11"><v id="11"></v>And the children of Juda, and the children of Israel shall be gathered together: and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land: for great is the day of Jezrahel. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="28.9.8"><v id="8"></v>The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: the prophet is become a snare of ruin upon all his ways, madness is in the house of his God. </bcv></p0>
