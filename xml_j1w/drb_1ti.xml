<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.1"><v id="1"></v>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus our hope: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.2"><v id="2"></v>To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.3"><v id="3"></v>As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.4"><v id="4"></v>Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies: which furnish questions rather than the edification of God, which is in faith. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.5"><v id="5"></v>Now the end of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.6"><v id="6"></v>From which things some going astray, are turned aside unto vain babbling: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.7"><v id="7"></v>Desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither the things they say, nor whereof they affirm. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.8"><v id="8"></v>But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.9"><v id="9"></v>Knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man, but for the unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly, and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.10"><v id="10"></v>For fornicators, for them who defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and whatever other thing is contrary to sound doctrine, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.11"><v id="11"></v>Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which hath been committed to my trust. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.12"><v id="12"></v>I give thanks who hath strengthened me, even to Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he hath counted me faithful, putting me in the ministry; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.13"><v id="13"></v>Who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and contumelious. But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.14"><v id="14"></v>Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.15"><v id="15"></v>A faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.16"><v id="16"></v>But for this cause have I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might shew forth all patience, for the information of them that shall believe in him unto life everlasting. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.17"><v id="17"></v>Now to the king of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.18"><v id="18"></v>This precept I commend to thee, O son Timothy; according to the prophecies going before on thee, that thou war in them a good warfare, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.19"><v id="19"></v>Having faith and a good conscience, which some rejecting have made shipwreck concerning the faith. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.1.20"><v id="20"></v>Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered up to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.1"><v id="1"></v>I desire therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.2"><v id="2"></v>For kings, and for all that are in high station: that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and chastity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.3"><v id="3"></v>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.4"><v id="4"></v>Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.5"><v id="5"></v>For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.6"><v id="6"></v>Who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.7"><v id="7"></v>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle, (I say the truth, I lie not,) a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.8"><v id="8"></v>I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without anger and contention. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.9"><v id="9"></v>In like manner women also in decent apparel: adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly attire, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.10"><v id="10"></v>But as it becometh women professing godliness, with good works. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.11"><v id="11"></v>Let the woman learn in silence, with all subjection. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.12"><v id="12"></v>But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to use authority over the man: but to be in silence. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.13"><v id="13"></v>For Adam was first formed; then Eve. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.14"><v id="14"></v>And Adam was not seduced; but the woman being seduced, was in the transgression. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.2.15"><v id="15"></v>Yet she shall be saved through childbearing; if she continue in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.2"><v id="2"></v>It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, given to hospitality, a teacher, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.3"><v id="3"></v>Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not quarrelsome, not covetous, but </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.4"><v id="4"></v>One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all chastity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.5"><v id="5"></v>But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.6"><v id="6"></v>Not a neophyte: lest being puffed up with pride, he fall into the judgment of the devil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.7"><v id="7"></v>Moreover he must have a good testimony of them who are without: lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.8"><v id="8"></v>Deacons in like manner chaste, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.9"><v id="9"></v>Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.10"><v id="10"></v>And let these also first be proved: and so let them minister, having no crime. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.11"><v id="11"></v>The women in like manner chaste, not slanderers, but sober, faithful in all things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.12"><v id="12"></v>Let deacons be the husbands of one wife: who rule well their children, and their own houses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.13"><v id="13"></v>For they that have ministered well, shall purchase to themselves a good degree, and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.14"><v id="14"></v>These things I write to thee, hoping that I shall come to thee shortly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.15"><v id="15"></v>But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.3.16"><v id="16"></v>And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared unto angels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed in the world, is taken up in glory. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.1"><v id="1"></v>Now the Spirit manifestly saith, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error, and doctrines of devils, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.2"><v id="2"></v>Speaking lies in hypocrisy, and having their conscience seared, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.3"><v id="3"></v>Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful, and by them that have known the truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.4"><v id="4"></v>For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.5"><v id="5"></v>For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.6"><v id="6"></v>These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished up in the words of faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast attained unto. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.7"><v id="7"></v>But avoid foolish and old wives' fables: and exercise thyself unto godliness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.8"><v id="8"></v>For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.9"><v id="9"></v>A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.10"><v id="10"></v>For therefore we labor and are reviled, because we hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.14"><v id="14"></v>Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by prophesy, with imposition of the hands of the priesthood. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.15"><v id="15"></v>Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things: that thy profiting may be manifest to all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.4.16"><v id="16"></v>Take heed to thyself and to doctrine: be earnest in them. For in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.2"><v id="2"></v>Old women, as mothers: young women, as sisters, in all chastity. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.4"><v id="4"></v>But if any widow have children, or grandchildren, let her learn first to govern her own house, and to make a return of duty to her parents: for this is acceptable before God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.5"><v id="5"></v>But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her trust in God, and continue in supplications and prayers night and day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.6"><v id="6"></v>For she that liveth in pleasures, is dead while she is living. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.7"><v id="7"></v>And this give in charge, that they may be blameless. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.8"><v id="8"></v>But if any man have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.9"><v id="9"></v>Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of age, who hath been the wife of one husband. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.11"><v id="11"></v>But the younger widows avoid. For when they have grown wanton in Christ, they will marry: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.12"><v id="12"></v>Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.13"><v id="13"></v>And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tattlers also, and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.14"><v id="14"></v>I will therefore that the younger should marry, bear children, be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.15"><v id="15"></v>For some are already turned aside after Satan. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.16"><v id="16"></v>If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and let not the church be charged: that there may be sufficient for them that are widows indeed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.17"><v id="17"></v>Let the priests that rule well, be esteemed worthy of double honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.18"><v id="18"></v>For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="54.5.21"><v id="21"></v>I charge thee before God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by declining to either side. </bcv></p0>
