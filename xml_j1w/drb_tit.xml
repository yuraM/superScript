<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.2"><v id="2"></v>Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.3"><v id="3"></v>But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.4"><v id="4"></v>To Titus my beloved son, according to the common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Savior. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.5"><v id="5"></v>For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.6"><v id="6"></v>If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.7"><v id="7"></v>For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.8"><v id="8"></v>But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.9"><v id="9"></v>Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gainsayers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.10"><v id="10"></v>For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.11"><v id="11"></v>Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.12"><v id="12"></v>One of them a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.13"><v id="13"></v>This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.14"><v id="14"></v>Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.15"><v id="15"></v>All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.1.16"><v id="16"></v>They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work reprobate. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="56.2.9"><v id="9"></v>Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters, in all things pleasing, not gainsaying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.2.10"><v id="10"></v>Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="56.2.14"><v id="14"></v>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.2.15"><v id="15"></v>These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="56.3.3"><v id="3"></v>For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="56.3.8"><v id="8"></v>It is a faithful saying: and these things I will have thee affirm constantly: that they, who believe in God, may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="56.3.9"><v id="9"></v>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain. </bcv></p0>
