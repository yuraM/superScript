<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.1"><v id="1"></v>FORASMUCH as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a narration of the things that have been accomplished among us; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.2"><v id="2"></v>According as they have delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.3"><v id="3"></v>It seemed good to me also, having diligently attained to all things from the beginning, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.4"><v id="4"></v>That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast been instructed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.5"><v id="5"></v>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zachary, of the course of Abia; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.6"><v id="6"></v>And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and justifications of the Lord without blame. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.7"><v id="7"></v>And they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.8"><v id="8"></v>And it came to pass, when he executed the priestly function in the order of his course before God, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.9"><v id="9"></v>According to the custom of the priestly office, it was his lot to offer incense, going into the temple of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.10"><v id="10"></v>And all the multitude of the people was praying without, at the hour of incense. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.11"><v id="11"></v>And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the alter of incense. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.12"><v id="12"></v>And Zachary seeing him, was troubled, and fear fell upon him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.13"><v id="13"></v>But the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachary, for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.14"><v id="14"></v>And thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice in his nativity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.15"><v id="15"></v>For he shall be great before the Lord; and shall drink no wine nor strong drink: and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.16"><v id="16"></v>And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.17"><v id="17"></v>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias; that he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the incredulous to the wisdom of the just, to prepare unto the Lord a perfect people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.18"><v id="18"></v>And Zachary said to the angel: Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.19"><v id="19"></v>And the angel answering, said to him: I am Gabriel, who stand before God: and am sent to speak to thee, and to bring thee these good tidings. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.20"><v id="20"></v>And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be able to speak until the day wherein these things shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.21"><v id="21"></v>And the people were waiting for Zachary; and they wondered that he tarried so long in the temple. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.22"><v id="22"></v>And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them, and remained dumb. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.23"><v id="23"></v>And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he departed to his own house. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.24"><v id="24"></v>And after those days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.25"><v id="25"></v>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had regard to take away my reproach among men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.26"><v id="26"></v>And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.27"><v id="27"></v>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.28"><v id="28"></v>And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.29"><v id="29"></v>Who having heard, was troubled at his saying, and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.30"><v id="30"></v>And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.31"><v id="31"></v>Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.32"><v id="32"></v>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.33"><v id="33"></v>And of his kingdom there shall be no end. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.34"><v id="34"></v>And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.35"><v id="35"></v>And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.36"><v id="36"></v>And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.37"><v id="37"></v>Because no word shall be impossible with God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.38"><v id="38"></v>And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.39"><v id="39"></v>And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.40"><v id="40"></v>And she entered into the house of Zachary, and saluted Elizabeth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.41"><v id="41"></v>And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.42"><v id="42"></v>And she cried out with a loud voice, and said: Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.43"><v id="43"></v>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.44"><v id="44"></v>For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.45"><v id="45"></v>And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.46"><v id="46"></v>And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.47"><v id="47"></v>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.48"><v id="48"></v>Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.49"><v id="49"></v>Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; and holy is his name. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.50"><v id="50"></v>And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.51"><v id="51"></v>He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.52"><v id="52"></v>He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the humble. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.53"><v id="53"></v>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.54"><v id="54"></v>He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.55"><v id="55"></v>As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.56"><v id="56"></v>And Mary abode with her about three months; and she returned to her own house. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.57"><v id="57"></v>Now Elizabeth's full time of being delivered was come, and she brought forth a son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.58"><v id="58"></v>And her neighbours and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed his great mercy towards her, and they congratulated with her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.59"><v id="59"></v>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him by his father's name Zachary. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.60"><v id="60"></v>And his mother answering, said: Not so; but he shall be called John. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.61"><v id="61"></v>And they said to her: There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.62"><v id="62"></v>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.63"><v id="63"></v>And demanding a writing table, he wrote, saying: John is his name. And they all wondered. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.64"><v id="64"></v>And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.65"><v id="65"></v>And fear came upon all their neighbours; and all these things were noised abroad over all the hill country of Judea. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.66"><v id="66"></v>And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart, saying: What an one, think ye, shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.67"><v id="67"></v>And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost; and he prophesied, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.68"><v id="68"></v>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.69"><v id="69"></v>And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us, in the house of David his servant: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.70"><v id="70"></v>As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who are from the beginning: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.71"><v id="71"></v>Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.72"><v id="72"></v>To perform mercy to our fathers, and to remember his holy testament, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.73"><v id="73"></v>The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father, that he would grant to us, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.74"><v id="74"></v>That being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.75"><v id="75"></v>In holiness and justice before him, all our days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.76"><v id="76"></v>And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.77"><v id="77"></v>To give knowledge of salvation to his people, unto the remission of their sins: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.78"><v id="78"></v>Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, in which the Orient from on high hath visited us: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.79"><v id="79"></v>To enlighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: to direct our feet into the way of peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.1.80"><v id="80"></v>And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit; and was in the deserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.1"><v id="1"></v>AND it came to pass, that in those days there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that the whole world should be enrolled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.2"><v id="2"></v>This enrolling was first made by Cyrinus, the governor of Syria. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And all went to be enrolled, every one into his own city. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.4"><v id="4"></v>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem: because he was of the house and family of David, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.5"><v id="5"></v>To be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was with child. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.6"><v id="6"></v>And it came to pass, that when they were there, her days were accomplished, that she should be delivered. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.7"><v id="7"></v>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him up in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.8"><v id="8"></v>And there were in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping the night watches over their flock. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.9"><v id="9"></v>And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the brightness of God shone round about them; and they feared with a great fear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.10"><v id="10"></v>And the angel said to them: Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, that shall be to all the people: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.11"><v id="11"></v>For, this day, is born to you a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.13"><v id="13"></v>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God, and saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.14"><v id="14"></v>Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace to men of good will. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.15"><v id="15"></v>And it came to pass, after the angels departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem, and let us see this word that is come to pass, which the Lord hath shewed to us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.16"><v id="16"></v>And they came with haste; and they found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.22"><v id="22"></v>And after the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses, were accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.23"><v id="23"></v>As it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.28"><v id="28"></v>He also took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.37"><v id="37"></v>And she was a widow until fourscore and four years; who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers serving night and day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.38"><v id="38"></v>Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the Lord; and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.44"><v id="44"></v>And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.45"><v id="45"></v>And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.46"><v id="46"></v>And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.48"><v id="48"></v>And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.49"><v id="49"></v>And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? did you not know, that I must be about my father's business? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.50"><v id="50"></v>And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.2.51"><v id="51"></v>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.6"><v id="6"></v>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.7"><v id="7"></v>He said therefore to the multitudes that went forth to be baptized by him: Ye offspring of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.8"><v id="8"></v>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of penance; and do not begin to say, We have Abraham for our father. For I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.9"><v id="9"></v>For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down and cast into the fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.10"><v id="10"></v>And the people asked him, saying: What then shall we do? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.11"><v id="11"></v>And he answering, said to them: He that hath two coats, let him give to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do in like manner. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.12"><v id="12"></v>And the publicans also came to be baptized, and said to him: Master, what shall we do? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.13"><v id="13"></v>But he said to them: Do nothing more than that which is appointed you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.14"><v id="14"></v>And the soldiers also asked him, saying: And what shall we do? And he said to them: Do violence to no man; neither calumniate any man; and be content with your pay. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.15"><v id="15"></v>And as the people were of opinion, and all were thinking in their hearts of John, that perhaps he might be the Christ; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.16"><v id="16"></v>John answered, saying unto all: I indeed baptize you with water; but there shall come one mightier that I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to loose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.17"><v id="17"></v>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.18"><v id="18"></v>And many other things exhorting, did he preach to the people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.19"><v id="19"></v>But Herod the tetrarch, when he was reproved by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.20"><v id="20"></v>He added this also above all, and shut up John in prison. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.21"><v id="21"></v>Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also being baptized and praying, heaven was opened; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.3.22"><v id="22"></v>And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, as a dove upon him; and a voice came from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.2"><v id="2"></v>For the space of forty days; and was tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days; and when they were ended, he was hungry. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.4"><v id="4"></v>And Jesus answered him: It is written, that Man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.5"><v id="5"></v>And the devil led him into a high mountain, and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time; </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.9"><v id="9"></v>And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and he said to him: If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself from hence. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.10"><v id="10"></v>For it is written, that He hath given his angels charge over thee, that they keep thee. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.14"><v id="14"></v>And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit, into Galilee, and the fame of him went out through the whole country. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.15"><v id="15"></v>And he taught in their synagogues, and was magnified by all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.16"><v id="16"></v>And he came to Nazareth, where he was brought up: and he went into the synagogue, according to his custom, on the sabbath day; and he rose up to read. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.17"><v id="17"></v>And the book of Isaias the prophet was delivered unto him. And as he unfolded the book, he found the place where it was written: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.18"><v id="18"></v>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me. Wherefore he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, he hath sent me to heal the contrite of heart, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.19"><v id="19"></v>To preach deliverance to the captives, and sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of reward. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.20"><v id="20"></v>And when he had folded the book, he restored it to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.21"><v id="21"></v>And he began to say to them: This day is fulfilled this scripture in your ears. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.22"><v id="22"></v>And all gave testimony to him: and they wondered at the words of grace that proceeded from his mouth, and they said: Is not this the son of Joseph? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.23"><v id="23"></v>And he said to them: Doubtless you will say to me this similitude: Physician, heal thyself: as great things as we have heard done in Capharnaum, do also here in thy own country. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.24"><v id="24"></v>And he said: Amen I say to you, that no prophet is accepted in his own country. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.25"><v id="25"></v>In truth I say to you, there were many widows in the days of Elias in Israel, when heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there was a great famine throughout all the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.26"><v id="26"></v>And to none of them was Elias sent, but to Sarepta of Sidon, to a widow woman. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.27"><v id="27"></v>And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet: and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.28"><v id="28"></v>And all they in the synagogue, hearing these things, were filled with anger. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.29"><v id="29"></v>And they rose up and thrust him out of the city; and they brought him to the brow of the hill, whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.30"><v id="30"></v>But he passing through the midst of them, went his way. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.31"><v id="31"></v>And he went down into Capharnaum, a city of Galilee, and there he taught them on the sabbath days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.32"><v id="32"></v>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his speech was with power. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.33"><v id="33"></v>And in the synagogue there was a man who had an unclean devil, and he cried out with a loud voice, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.34"><v id="34"></v>Saying: Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.35"><v id="35"></v>And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Hold thy peace, and go out of him. And when the devil had thrown him into the midst, he went out of him, and hurt him not at all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.36"><v id="36"></v>And there came fear upon all, and they talked among themselves, saying: What word is this, for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they go out? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.37"><v id="37"></v>And the fame of him was published into every place of the country. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.38"><v id="38"></v>And Jesus rising up out of the synagogue, went into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever, and they besought him for her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.39"><v id="39"></v>And standing over her, he commanded the fever, and it left her. And immediately rising, she ministered to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.40"><v id="40"></v>And when the sun was down, all they that had any sick with divers diseases, brought them to him. But he laying his hands on every one of them, healed them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.41"><v id="41"></v>And devils went out from many, crying out and saying: Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them he suffered them not to speak, for they knew that he was Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.42"><v id="42"></v>And when it was day, going out he went into a desert place, and the multitudes sought him, and came unto him: and they stayed him that he should not depart from them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.4.43"><v id="43"></v>To whom he said: To other cities also I must preach the kingdom of God: for therefore am I sent. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.2"><v id="2"></v>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.3"><v id="3"></v>And going into one of the ships that was Simon's, he desired him to draw back a little from the land. And sitting he taught the multitudes out of the ship. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.4"><v id="4"></v>Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to Simon: Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.5"><v id="5"></v>And Simon answering said to him: Master, we have labored all the night, and have taken nothing: but at thy word I will let down the net. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.6"><v id="6"></v>And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great multitude of fishes, and their net broke. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.7"><v id="7"></v>And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they were almost sinking. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.9"><v id="9"></v>For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.10"><v id="10"></v>And so were also James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. And Jesus saith to Simon: Fear not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.11"><v id="11"></v>And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they followed him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.12"><v id="12"></v>And it came to pass, when he was ina certain city, behold a man full of leprosy, who seeing Jesus, and falling on his face, besought him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.13"><v id="13"></v>And stretching forth his hand, he touched him, saying: I will. Be thou cleansed. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.14"><v id="14"></v>And he charged him that he should tell no man, but, Go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.15"><v id="15"></v>But the fame of him went abroad the more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.16"><v id="16"></v>And he retired into the desert, and prayed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.17"><v id="17"></v>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he sat teaching, that there were also Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, that were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was to heal them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.18"><v id="18"></v>And behold, men brought in a bed a man, who had the palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.19"><v id="19"></v>And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went up upon the roof, and let him down through the tiles with his bed into the midst before Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.20"><v id="20"></v>Whose faith when he saw, he said: Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.22"><v id="22"></v>And when Jesus knew their thoughts, answering, he said to them: What is it you think in your hearts? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.25"><v id="25"></v>And immediately rising up before them, he took up the bed on which he lay; and he went away to his own house, glorifying God. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.32"><v id="32"></v>I came not to call the just, but sinners to penance. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.33"><v id="33"></v>And they said to him: Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees in like manner; but thine eat and drink? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.34"><v id="34"></v>To whom he said: Can you make the children of the bridegroom fast, whilst the bridegroom is with them? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.35"><v id="35"></v>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then shall they fast in those days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.36"><v id="36"></v>And he spoke also a similitude to them: That no man putteth a piece from a new garment upon an old garment; otherwise he both rendeth the new, and the piece taken from the new agreeth not with the old. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.5.37"><v id="37"></v>And no man putteth new wine into old bottle: otherwise the new wine will break the bottles, and it will be spilled, and the bottles will be lost. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.12"><v id="12"></v>And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and he passed the whole night in the prayer of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.13"><v id="13"></v>And when day was come, he called unto him his disciples; and he chose twelve of them (whom also he named apostles): </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.14"><v id="14"></v>Simon, whom he surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.15"><v id="15"></v>Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon who is called Zelotes, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.16"><v id="16"></v>And Jude, the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was the traitor. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.17"><v id="17"></v>And coming down with them, he stood in a plain place, and the company of his disciples, and a very great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast both of Tyre and Sidon, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.18"><v id="18"></v>Who were come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases. And they that were troubled with unclean spirits, were cured. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.19"><v id="19"></v>And all the multitude sought to touch him, for virtue went out from him, and healed all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.20"><v id="20"></v>And he, lifting up his eyes on his disciples, said: Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.21"><v id="21"></v>Blessed are ye that hunger now: for you shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for you shall laugh. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.22"><v id="22"></v>Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.23"><v id="23"></v>Be glad in that day and rejoice; for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For according to these things did their fathers to the prophets. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.24"><v id="24"></v>But woe to you that are rich: for you have your consolation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.25"><v id="25"></v>Woe to you that are filled: for you shall hunger. Woe to you that now laugh: for you shall mourn and weep. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.26"><v id="26"></v>Woe to you when men shall bless you: for according to these things did their fathers to the false prophets. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.27"><v id="27"></v>But I say to you that hear: Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.28"><v id="28"></v>Bless them that curse you, and pray for them that calumniate you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.29"><v id="29"></v>And to him that striketh thee on the one cheek, offer also the other. And him that taketh away from thee thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.30"><v id="30"></v>Give to every one that asketh thee, and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.31"><v id="31"></v>And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them in like manner. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.32"><v id="32"></v>And if you love them that love you, what thanks are to you? for sinners also love those that love them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.33"><v id="33"></v>And if you do good to them who do good to you, what thanks are to you? for sinners also do this. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.34"><v id="34"></v>And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thanks are to you? for sinners also lend to sinners, for to receive as much. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.35"><v id="35"></v>But love ye your enemies: do good, and lend, hoping for nothing thereby: and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the unthankful, and to the evil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.36"><v id="36"></v>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.37"><v id="37"></v>Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.38"><v id="38"></v>Give, and it shall be given to you: good measure and pressed down and shaken together and running over shall they give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you shall mete withal, it shall be measured to you again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.39"><v id="39"></v>And he spoke also to them a similitude: Can the blind lead the blind? do they not both fall into the ditch? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.40"><v id="40"></v>The disciple is not above his master: but every one shall be perfect, if he be as his master. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.41"><v id="41"></v>And why seest thou the mote in thy brother's eye: but the beam that is in thy own eye thou considerest not? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.42"><v id="42"></v>Or how canst thou say to thy brother: Brother, let me pull the mote out of thy eye, when thou thyself seest not the beam in thy own eye? Hypocrite, cast first the beam out of thy own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to take out the mote from thy brother's eye. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.43"><v id="43"></v>For there is no good tree that bringeth forth evil fruit; nor an evil tree that bringeth forth good fruit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.44"><v id="44"></v>For every tree is known by its fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns; nor from a bramble bush do they gather the grape. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.45"><v id="45"></v>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil. For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.46"><v id="46"></v>And why call you me, Lord, Lord; and do not the things which I say? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.47"><v id="47"></v>Every one that cometh to me, and heareth my words, and doth them, I will shew you to whom he is like. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.48"><v id="48"></v>He is like to a man building a house, who digged deep, and laid the foundation upon a rock. And when a flood came, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and it could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.6.49"><v id="49"></v>But he that heareth, and doth not, is like to a man building his house upon the earth without a foundation: against which the stream beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.2"><v id="2"></v>And the servant of a certain centurion, who was dear to him, being sick, was ready to die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.3"><v id="3"></v>And when he had heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the ancients of the Jews, desiring him to come and heal his servant. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.4"><v id="4"></v>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying to him: He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.5"><v id="5"></v>For he loveth our nation; and he hath built us a synagogue. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.6"><v id="6"></v>And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent his friends to him, saying: Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.7"><v id="7"></v>For which cause neither did I think myself worthy to come to thee; but say the word, and my servant shall be healed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.8"><v id="8"></v>For I also am a man subject to authority, having under me soldiers: and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.9"><v id="9"></v>Which Jesus hearing, marvelled: and turning about to the multitude that followed him, he said: Amen I say to you, I have not found so great faith, not even in Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.10"><v id="10"></v>And they who were sent, being returned to the house, found the servant whole who had been sick. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.11"><v id="11"></v>And it came to pass afterwards, that he went into a city that is called Naim; and there went with him his disciples, and a great multitude. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.12"><v id="12"></v>And when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow: and a great multitude of the city was with her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.13"><v id="13"></v>Whom when the Lord had seen, being moved with mercy towards her, he said to her: Weep not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.14"><v id="14"></v>And he came near and touched the bier. And they that carried it, stood still. And he said: Young man, I say to thee, arise. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.15"><v id="15"></v>And he that was dead, sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.16"><v id="16"></v>And there came a fear on them all: and they glorified God, saying: A great prophet is risen up among us: and, God hath visited his people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.17"><v id="17"></v>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judea, and throughout all the country round about. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.18"><v id="18"></v>And John's disciples told him of all these things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.19"><v id="19"></v>And John called to him two of his disciples, and sent them to Jesus, saying: Art thou he that art to come; or look we for another? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.20"><v id="20"></v>And when the men were come unto him, they said: John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying: Art thou he that art to come; or look we for another? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.21"><v id="21"></v>(And in that same hour, he cured many of their diseases, and hurts, and evil spirits: and to many that were blind he gave sight.) </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.22"><v id="22"></v>And answering, he said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen: the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, to the poor the gospel is preached: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.23"><v id="23"></v>And blessed is he whosoever shall not be scandalized in me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.24"><v id="24"></v>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak to the multitudes concerning John. What went ye out into the desert to see? a reed shaken with the wind? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.25"><v id="25"></v>But what went you out to see? a man clothed in soft garments? Behold they that are in costly apparel and live delicately, are in the houses of kings. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.26"><v id="26"></v>But what went you out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.27"><v id="27"></v>This is he of whom it is written: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.28"><v id="28"></v>For I say to you: Amongst those that are born of women, there is not a greater prophet that John the Baptist. But he that is the lesser in the kingdom of God, is greater than he. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.29"><v id="29"></v>And all the people hearing, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with John's baptism. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.30"><v id="30"></v>But the Pharisees and the lawyers despised the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized by him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.31"><v id="31"></v>And the Lord said: Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.32"><v id="32"></v>They are like to children sitting in the marketplace, and speaking one to another, and saying: We have piped to you, and you have not danced: we have mourned, and you have not wept. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.33"><v id="33"></v>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say: He hath a devil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.34"><v id="34"></v>The Son of man is come eating and drinking: and you say: Behold a man that is a glutton and a drinker of wine, a friend of publicans and sinners. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.35"><v id="35"></v>And wisdom is justified by all her children. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.36"><v id="36"></v>And one of the Pharisees desired him to eat with him. And he went into the house of the Pharisee, and sat down to meat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.37"><v id="37"></v>And behold a woman that was in the city, a sinner, when she knew that he sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.38"><v id="38"></v>And standing behind at his feet, she began to wash his feet, with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.39"><v id="39"></v>And the Pharisee, who had invited him, seeing it, spoke within himself, saying: This man, if he were a prophet, would know surely who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.40"><v id="40"></v>And Jesus answering, said to him: Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. But he said: Master, say it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.41"><v id="41"></v>A certain creditor had two debtors, the one who owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.42"><v id="42"></v>And whereas they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which therefore of the two loveth him most? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.43"><v id="43"></v>Simon answering, said: I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said to him: Thou hast judged rightly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.44"><v id="44"></v>And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon: Dost thou see this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she with tears hath washed my feet, and with her hairs hath wiped them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.45"><v id="45"></v>Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, since she came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.46"><v id="46"></v>My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she with ointment hath anointed my feet. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.47"><v id="47"></v>Wherefore I say to thee: Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much. But to whom less is forgiven, he loveth less. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.48"><v id="48"></v>And he said to her: Thy sins are forgiven thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.49"><v id="49"></v>And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves: Who is this that forgiveth sins also? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.7.50"><v id="50"></v>And he said to the woman: Thy faith hath made thee safe, go in peace. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.1"><v id="1"></v>AND it came to pass afterwards, that he travelled through the cities and towns, preaching and evangelizing the kingdom of God; and the twelve with him: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.2"><v id="2"></v>And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary who is called Magdalen, out of whom seven devils were gone forth, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.3"><v id="3"></v>And Joanna the wife of Chusa, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who ministered unto him of their substance. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.4"><v id="4"></v>And when a very great multitude was gathered together, and hastened out of the cities unto him, he spoke by a similitude. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.5"><v id="5"></v>The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.6"><v id="6"></v>And other some fell upon a rock: and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.7"><v id="7"></v>And other some fell among thorns, and the thorns growing up with it, choked it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.8"><v id="8"></v>And other some fell upon good ground; and being sprung up, yielded fruit a hundredfold. Saying these things, he cried out: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.9"><v id="9"></v>And his disciples asked him what this parable might be. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.10"><v id="10"></v>To whom he said: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing may not understand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.11"><v id="11"></v>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.12"><v id="12"></v>And they by the way side are they that hear; then the devil cometh, and taketh the word out of their heart, lest believing they should be saved. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.13"><v id="13"></v>Now they upon the rock, are they who when they hear, receive the word with joy: and these have no roots; for they believe for a while, and in time of temptation, they fall away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.14"><v id="14"></v>And that which fell among thorns, are they who have heard, and going their way, are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and yield no fruit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.15"><v id="15"></v>But that on the good ground, are they who in a good and perfect heart, hearing the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit in patience. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.16"><v id="16"></v>Now no man lighting a candle covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it upon a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.17"><v id="17"></v>For there is not any thing secret that shall not be made manifest, nor hidden, that shall not be known and come abroad. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.18"><v id="18"></v>Take heed therefore how you hear. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given: and whosoever hath not, that also which he thinketh he hath, shall be taken away from him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.19"><v id="19"></v>And his mother and brethren came unto him; and they could not come at him for the crowd. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.20"><v id="20"></v>And it was told him: Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.21"><v id="21"></v>Who answering, said to them: My mother and my brethren are they who hear the word of God, and do it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.22"><v id="22"></v>And it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a little ship with his disciples, and he said to them: Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.23"><v id="23"></v>And when they were sailing, he slept; and there came down a storm of wind upon the lake, and they were filled, and were in danger. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.24"><v id="24"></v>And they came and awaked him, saying: Master, we perish. But he arising, rebuked the wind and the rage of the water; and it ceased, and there was a calm. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.25"><v id="25"></v>And he said to them: Where is your faith? Who being afraid, wondered, saying one to another: Who is this, (think you), that he commandeth both the winds and the sea, and they obey him? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.26"><v id="26"></v>And they sailed to the country of the Gerasens, which is over against Galilee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.27"><v id="27"></v>And when he was come forth to the land, there met him a certain man who had a devil now a very long time, and he wore no clothes, neither did he abide in a house, but in the sepulchres. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.28"><v id="28"></v>And when he saw Jesus, he fell down before him; and crying out with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.29"><v id="29"></v>For he commanded the unclean spirit to go out of the man. For many times it seized him, and he was bound with chains, and kept in fetters; and breaking the bonds, he was driven by the devil into the deserts. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.30"><v id="30"></v>And Jesus asked him, saying: What is thy name? But he said: Legion; because many devils were entered into him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.31"><v id="31"></v>And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the abyss. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.32"><v id="32"></v>And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.33"><v id="33"></v>The devils therefore went out of the man, and entered into the swine; and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were stifled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.34"><v id="34"></v>Which when they that fed them saw done, they fled away, and told it in the city and in the villages. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.35"><v id="35"></v>And they went out to see what was done; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at his feet, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.36"><v id="36"></v>And they also that had seen, told them how he had been healed from the legion. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.37"><v id="37"></v>And all the multitude of the country of the Gerasens besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear. And he, going up into the ship, returned back again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.38"><v id="38"></v>Now the man, out of whom the devils were departed, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.39"><v id="39"></v>Return to thy house, and tell how great things God hath done to thee. And he went through the whole city, publishing how great things Jesus had done to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.40"><v id="40"></v>And it came to pass, that when Jesus was returned, the multitude received him: for they were all waiting for him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.41"><v id="41"></v>And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, beseeching him that he would come into his house: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.42"><v id="42"></v>For he had an only daughter, almost twelve years old, and she was dying. And it happened as he went, that he was thronged by the multitudes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.43"><v id="43"></v>And there was a certain woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had bestowed all her substance on physicians, and could not be healed by any. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.44"><v id="44"></v>She came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment; and immediately the issue of her blood stopped. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.45"><v id="45"></v>And Jesus said: Who is it that touched me? And all denying, Peter and they that were with him said: Master, the multitudes throng and press thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.46"><v id="46"></v>And Jesus said: Somebody hath touched me; for I know that virtue is gone out from me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.47"><v id="47"></v>And the woman seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and fell down before his feet, and declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was immediately healed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.48"><v id="48"></v>But he said to her: Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go thy way in peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.49"><v id="49"></v>As he was yet speaking, there cometh one to the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him: Thy daughter is dead, trouble him not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.50"><v id="50"></v>And Jesus hearing this word, answered the father of the maid: Fear not; believe only, and she shall be safe. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.51"><v id="51"></v>And when he was come to the house, he suffered not any man to go in with him, but Peter and James and John, and the father and mother of the maiden. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.52"><v id="52"></v>And all wept and mourned for her. But he said: Weep not; the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.53"><v id="53"></v>And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.54"><v id="54"></v>But he taking her by the hand, cried out, saying: Maid, arise. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.55"><v id="55"></v>And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And he bid them give her to eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.8.56"><v id="56"></v>And her parents were astonished, whom he charged to tell no man what was done. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.1"><v id="1"></v>THEN calling together the twelve apostles, he gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.2"><v id="2"></v>And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.3"><v id="3"></v>And he said to them: Take nothing for your journey; neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.4"><v id="4"></v>And whatsoever house you shall enter into, abide there, and depart not from thence. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.5"><v id="5"></v>And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off even the dust of your feet, for a testimony against them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.6"><v id="6"></v>And going out, they went about through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.7"><v id="7"></v>Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard of all things that were done by him; and he was in a doubt, because it was said </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.8"><v id="8"></v>By some, that John was risen from the dead: but by other some, that Elias had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.9"><v id="9"></v>And Herod said: John I have beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.10"><v id="10"></v>And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all they had done. And taking them, he went aside into a desert place, apart, which belongeth to Bethsaida. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.11"><v id="11"></v>Which when the people knew, they followed him; and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed them who had need of healing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.12"><v id="12"></v>Now the day began to decline. And the twelve came and said to him: Send away the multitude, that going into the towns and villages round about, they may lodge and get victuals; for we are here in a desert place. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.13"><v id="13"></v>But he said to them: Give you them to eat. And they said: We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; unless perhaps we should go and buy food for all this multitude. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.14"><v id="14"></v>Now there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples: Make them sit down by fifties in a company. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.15"><v id="15"></v>And they did so; and made them all sit down. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.16"><v id="16"></v>And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed them; and he broke, and distributed to his disciples, to set before the multitude. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.17"><v id="17"></v>And they did all eat, and were filled. And there were taken up of fragments that remained to them, twelve baskets. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.18"><v id="18"></v>And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples also were with him: and he asked them, saying: Whom do the people say that I am? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.19"><v id="19"></v>But they answered, and said: John the Baptist; but some say Elias; and others say that one of the former prophets is risen again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.20"><v id="20"></v>And he said to them: But whom do you say that I am? Simon Peter answering, said: The Christ of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.21"><v id="21"></v>But he strictly charging them, commanded they should tell this to no man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.22"><v id="22"></v>Saying: The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the ancients and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day rise again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.23"><v id="23"></v>And he said to all: If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.24"><v id="24"></v>For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; for he that shall lose his life for my sake, shall save it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.25"><v id="25"></v>For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, and cast away himself? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.26"><v id="26"></v>For he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him the Son of man shall be ashamed, when he shall come in his majesty, and that of his Father, and of the holy angels. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.27"><v id="27"></v>But I tell you of a truth: There are some standing here that shall not taste death, till they see the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.28"><v id="28"></v>And it came to pass about eight days after these words, that he took Peter, and James, and John, and went up into a mountain to pray. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.29"><v id="29"></v>And whilst he prayed, the shape of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became white and glittering. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.30"><v id="30"></v>And behold two men were talking with him. And they were Moses and Elias, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.31"><v id="31"></v>Appearing in majesty. And they spoke of his decease that he should accomplish in Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.32"><v id="32"></v>But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep. And waking, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.33"><v id="33"></v>And it came to pass, that as they were departing from him, Peter saith to Jesus: Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias; not knowing what he said. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.34"><v id="34"></v>And as he spoke these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them; and they were afraid, when they entered into the cloud. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.35"><v id="35"></v>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son; hear him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.36"><v id="36"></v>And whilst the voice was uttered, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of these things which they had seen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.37"><v id="37"></v>And it came to pass the day following, when they came down from the mountain, there met him a great multitude. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.38"><v id="38"></v>And behold a man among the crowd cried out, saying: Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son, because he is my only one. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.39"><v id="39"></v>And lo, a spirit seizeth him, and he suddenly crieth out, and he throweth him down and teareth him, so that he foameth; and bruising him, he hardly departeth from him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.40"><v id="40"></v>And I desired thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.41"><v id="41"></v>And Jesus answering, said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring hither thy son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.42"><v id="42"></v>And as he was coming to him, the devil threw him down, and tore him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.43"><v id="43"></v>And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and cured the boy, and restored him to his father. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.44"><v id="44"></v>And all were astonished at the mighty power of God. But while all wondered at all the things he did, he said to his disciples: Lay you up in your hearts these words, for it shall come to pass, that the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.45"><v id="45"></v>But they understood not this word; and it was hid from them, so that they perceived it not. And they were afraid to ask him concerning this word. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.46"><v id="46"></v>And there entered a thought into them, which of them should be greater. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.47"><v id="47"></v>But Jesus seeing the thoughts of their heart, took a child and set him by him, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.48"><v id="48"></v>And said to them: Whosoever shall receive this child in my name, receiveth me; and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth him that sent me. For he that is the lesser among you all, he is the greater. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.49"><v id="49"></v>And John, answering, said: Master, we saw a certain man casting out devils in thy name, and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.50"><v id="50"></v>And Jesus said to him: Forbid him not; for he that is not against you, is for you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.51"><v id="51"></v>And it came to pass, when the days of his assumption were accomplishing, that he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.52"><v id="52"></v>And he sent messengers before his face; and going, they entered into a city of the Samaritans, to prepare for him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.53"><v id="53"></v>And they received him not, because his face was of one going to Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.54"><v id="54"></v>And when his disciples James and John had seen this, they said: Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.55"><v id="55"></v>And turning, he rebuked them, saying: You know not of what spirit you are. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.56"><v id="56"></v>The Son of man came not to destroy souls, but to save. And they went into another town. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.57"><v id="57"></v>And it came to pass, as they walked in the way, that a certain man said to him: I will follow thee withersoever thou goest. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.58"><v id="58"></v>Jesus said to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.59"><v id="59"></v>But he said to another: Follow me. And he said: Lord, suffer me first to go, and to bury my father. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.60"><v id="60"></v>And Jesus said to him: Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou, and preach the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.61"><v id="61"></v>And another said: I will follow thee, Lord; but let me first take my leave of them that are at my house. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.9.62"><v id="62"></v>Jesus said to him: No man putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.10.30"><v id="30"></v>And Jesus answering, said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who also stripped him, and having wounded him went away, leaving him half dead. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.10.35"><v id="35"></v>And the next day he took out two pence, and gave to the host, and said: Take care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above, I, at my return, will repay thee. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.5"><v id="5"></v>And he said to them: Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and shall say to him: Friend, lend me three loaves, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.6"><v id="6"></v>Because a friend of mine is come off his journey to me, and I have not what to set before him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.7"><v id="7"></v>And he from within should answer, and say: Trouble me not, the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.8"><v id="8"></v>Yet if he shall continue knocking, I say to you, although he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend; yet, because of his importunity, he will rise, and give him as many as he needeth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.9"><v id="9"></v>And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.10"><v id="10"></v>For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.11"><v id="11"></v>And which of you, if he ask his father bread, will he give him a stone? or a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.12"><v id="12"></v>Or if he shall ask an egg, will he reach him a scorpion? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.13"><v id="13"></v>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask him? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.14"><v id="14"></v>And he was casting out a devil, and the same was dumb: and when he had cast out the devil, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes were in admiration at it: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.15"><v id="15"></v>But some of them said: He casteth out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of devils. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.16"><v id="16"></v>And others tempting, asked of him a sign from heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.17"><v id="17"></v>But he seeing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself, shall be brought to desolation, and house upon house shall fall. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.18"><v id="18"></v>And if Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because you say, that through Beelzebub I cast out devils. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.19"><v id="19"></v>Now if I cast out devils by Beelzebub; by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.20"><v id="20"></v>But if I by the finger of God cast out devils; doubtless the kingdom of God is come upon you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.21"><v id="21"></v>When a strong man armed keepeth his court, those things are in peace which he possesseth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.22"><v id="22"></v>But if a stronger than he come upon him, and overcome him; he will take away all his armour wherein he trusted, and will distribute his spoils. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.23"><v id="23"></v>He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.24"><v id="24"></v>When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through places without water, seeking rest; and not finding, he saith: I will return into my house whence I came out. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.25"><v id="25"></v>And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.26"><v id="26"></v>Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and entering in they dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.27"><v id="27"></v>And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman from the crowd, lifting up her voice, said to him: Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the paps that gave thee suck. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.28"><v id="28"></v>But he said: Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God, and keep it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.29"><v id="29"></v>And the multitudes running together, he began to say: This generation is a wicked generation: it asketh a sign, and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.30"><v id="30"></v>For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninivites; so shall the Son of man also be to this generation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.31"><v id="31"></v>The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold more than Solomon here. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.32"><v id="32"></v>The men of Ninive shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas; and behold more than Jonas here. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.33"><v id="33"></v>No man lighteth a candle, and putteth it in a hidden place, nore under a bushel; but upon a candlestick, that they that come in, may see the light. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.34"><v id="34"></v>The light of thy body is thy eye. If thy eye be single, thy whole body will be lightsome: but if it be evil, thy body also will be darksome. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.35"><v id="35"></v>Take heed therefore, that the light which is in thee, be not darkness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.36"><v id="36"></v>If then thy whole body be lightsome, having no part of darkness; the whole shall be lightsome; and as a bright lamp, shall enlighten thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.37"><v id="37"></v>And as he was speaking, a certain Pharisee prayed him, that he would dine with him. And he going in, sat down to eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.38"><v id="38"></v>And the Pharisee began to say, thinking within himself, why he was not washed before dinner. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.39"><v id="39"></v>And the Lord said to him: Now you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inside is full of rapine and iniquity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.40"><v id="40"></v>Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without, make also that which is within? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.41"><v id="41"></v>But yet that which remaineth, give alms; and behold, all things are clean unto you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.42"><v id="42"></v>But woe to you, Pharisees, because you tithe mint and rue and every herb; and pass over judgment, and the charity of God. Now these things you ought to have done, and not to leave the other undone. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.43"><v id="43"></v>Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the marketplace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.44"><v id="44"></v>Woe to you, because you are as sepulchres that appear not, and men that walk over are not aware. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.45"><v id="45"></v>And one of the lawyers answering, saith to him: Master, in saying these things, thou reproachest us also. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.46"><v id="46"></v>But he said: Woe to you lawyers also, because you load men with burdens which they cannot bear, and you yourselves touch not the packs with one of your fingers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.47"><v id="47"></v>Woe to you who build the monuments of the prophets: and your fathers killed them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.48"><v id="48"></v>Truly you bear witness that you consent to the doings of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and you build their sepulchres. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.49"><v id="49"></v>For this cause also the wisdom of God said: I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.50"><v id="50"></v>That the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.51"><v id="51"></v>From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, who was slain between the alter and the temple: Yea I say to you, It shall be required of this generation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.52"><v id="52"></v>Woe to you lawyers, for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you yourselves have not entered in, and those that were entering in, you have hindered. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.53"><v id="53"></v>And as he was saying these things to them, the Pharisees and the lawyers began violently to urge him, and to oppress his mouth about many things, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.11.54"><v id="54"></v>Lying in wait for him, and seeking to catch something from his mouth, that they might accuse him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.5"><v id="5"></v>But I will shew you whom you shall fear: fear ye him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell. Yea, I say to you, fear him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.13"><v id="13"></v>And one of the multitude said to him: Master, speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.17"><v id="17"></v>And he thought within himself, saying: What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.18"><v id="18"></v>And he said: This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and will build greater; and into them will I gather all things that are grown to me, and my goods. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.41"><v id="41"></v>And Peter said to him: Lord, dost thou speak this parable to us, or likewise to all? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.42"><v id="42"></v>And the Lord said: Who (thinkest thou) is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord setteth over his family, to give them their measure of wheat in due season? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.43"><v id="43"></v>Blessed is that servant, whom when his lord shall come, he shall find so doing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.44"><v id="44"></v>Verily I say to you, he will set him over all that he possesseth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.45"><v id="45"></v>But if that servant shall say in his heart: My lord is long a coming; and shall begin to strike the menservants and maidservants, and to eat and to drink and be drunk: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.46"><v id="46"></v>The lord of that servant will come in the day that he hopeth not, and at the hour that he knoweth not, and shall separate him, and shall appoint him his portion with unbelievers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.47"><v id="47"></v>And that servant who knew the will of his lord, and prepared not himself, and did not according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.48"><v id="48"></v>But he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. And unto whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required: and to whom they have committed much, of him they will demand the more. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.49"><v id="49"></v>I am come to cast fire on the earth; and what will I, but that it be kindled? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.51"><v id="51"></v>Think ye, that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, no; but separation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.52"><v id="52"></v>For there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided: three against two, and two against three. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.53"><v id="53"></v>The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against his father, the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother, the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.54"><v id="54"></v>And he said also to the multitudes: When you see a cloud rising from the west, presently you say: A shower is coming: and so it happeneth: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.12.55"><v id="55"></v>And when ye see the south wind blow, you say: There will be heat: and it cometh to pass. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.13.19"><v id="19"></v>It is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and cast into his garden, and it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air lodged in the branches thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.13.20"><v id="20"></v>And again he said: Whereunto shall I esteem the kingdom of God to be like? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.13.21"><v id="21"></v>It is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.13.25"><v id="25"></v>But when the master of the house shall be gone in, and shall shut the door, you shall begin to stand without, and knock at the door, saying: Lord, open to us. And he answering, shall say to you: I know you not, whence you are. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.13.26"><v id="26"></v>Then you shall begin to say: We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.13.27"><v id="27"></v>And he shall say to you: I know you not, whence you are: depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.13.33"><v id="33"></v>Nevertheless I must walk to day and to morrow, and the day following, because it cannot be that a prophet perish, out of Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.13.34"><v id="34"></v>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children as the bird doth her brood under her wings, and thou wouldest not? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.14.13"><v id="13"></v>But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind; </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.14.17"><v id="17"></v>And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them that were invited, that they should come, for now all things are ready. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.14.18"><v id="18"></v>And they began all at once to make excuse. The first said to him: I have bought a farm, and I must needs go out and see it: I pray thee, hold me excused. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.14.19"><v id="19"></v>And another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to try them: I pray thee, hold me excused. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.14.21"><v id="21"></v>And the servant returning, told these things to his lord.

<p0><bcv bcv="42.14.22"><v id="22"></v>And the servant said: Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.15.7"><v id="7"></v>I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.15.11"><v id="11"></v>And he said: A certain man had two sons: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.15.13"><v id="13"></v>And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.15.14"><v id="14"></v>And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.15.15"><v id="15"></v>And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.15.16"><v id="16"></v>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.15.18"><v id="18"></v>I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.16.3"><v id="3"></v>And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.16.4"><v id="4"></v>I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.16.5"><v id="5"></v>Therefore calling together every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.16.8"><v id="8"></v>And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.7"><v id="7"></v>But which of you having a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he is come from the field: Immediately go, sit down to meat: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.8"><v id="8"></v>And will not rather say to him: Make ready my supper, and gird thyself, and serve me, whilst I eat and drink, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.9"><v id="9"></v>Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.10"><v id="10"></v>I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.11"><v id="11"></v>And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.12"><v id="12"></v>And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.13"><v id="13"></v>And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.14"><v id="14"></v>Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.15"><v id="15"></v>And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice glorifying God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.16"><v id="16"></v>And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks: and this was a Samaritan. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.17"><v id="17"></v>And Jesus answering, said, Were not ten made clean? and where are the nine? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.18"><v id="18"></v>There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.19"><v id="19"></v>And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee whole. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.20"><v id="20"></v>And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come? he answered them, and said: The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.21"><v id="21"></v>Neither shall they say: Behold here, or behold there. For lo, the kingdom of God is within you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.22"><v id="22"></v>And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.23"><v id="23"></v>And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.24"><v id="24"></v>For as the lightening that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.25"><v id="25"></v>But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.26"><v id="26"></v>And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.27"><v id="27"></v>They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.28"><v id="28"></v>Likewise as it came to pass, in the days of Lot: they did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they planted and built. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.29"><v id="29"></v>And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.30"><v id="30"></v>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.31"><v id="31"></v>In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.32"><v id="32"></v>Remember Lot's wife. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.33"><v id="33"></v>Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it, shall preserve it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.34"><v id="34"></v>I say to you: in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.35"><v id="35"></v>Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left: two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be keft. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.36"><v id="36"></v>They answering, say to him: Where, Lord? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.17.37"><v id="37"></v>Who said to them: Wheresoever the body shall be, thither will the eagles also be gathered together. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.1"><v id="1"></v>AND he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray, and not to faint, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.2"><v id="2"></v>Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God, nor regarded man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.3"><v id="3"></v>And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.4"><v id="4"></v>And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.5"><v id="5"></v>Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.6"><v id="6"></v>And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.7"><v id="7"></v>And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.8"><v id="8"></v>I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.9"><v id="9"></v>And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.10"><v id="10"></v>Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.11"><v id="11"></v>The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.12"><v id="12"></v>I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.13"><v id="13"></v>And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O god, be merciful to me a sinner. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.14"><v id="14"></v>I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.15"><v id="15"></v>And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.16"><v id="16"></v>But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.17"><v id="17"></v>Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall not enter into it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.18"><v id="18"></v>And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.19"><v id="19"></v>And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.20"><v id="20"></v>Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Honour thy father and mother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.21"><v id="21"></v>Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.22"><v id="22"></v>Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.23"><v id="23"></v>He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.24"><v id="24"></v>And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.25"><v id="25"></v>For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.26"><v id="26"></v>And they that heard it, said: Who then can be saved? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.27"><v id="27"></v>He said to them: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.28"><v id="28"></v>Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.30"><v id="30"></v>Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.31"><v id="31"></v>Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.32"><v id="32"></v>For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.33"><v id="33"></v>And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.34"><v id="34"></v>And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.35"><v id="35"></v>Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.36"><v id="36"></v>And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.37"><v id="37"></v>And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.38"><v id="38"></v>And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.39"><v id="39"></v>And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.40"><v id="40"></v>And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.41"><v id="41"></v>Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.18.42"><v id="42"></v>And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.4"><v id="4"></v>And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, that he might see him; for he was to pass that way. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.5"><v id="5"></v>And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him, and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy house. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.6"><v id="6"></v>And he made haste and came down; and received him with joy. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.8"><v id="8"></v>But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.9"><v id="9"></v>Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.10"><v id="10"></v>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.11"><v id="11"></v>As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.12"><v id="12"></v>He said therefore: A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.13"><v id="13"></v>And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said to them: Trade till I come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.14"><v id="14"></v>But his citizens hated him: and they sent an embassage after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.15"><v id="15"></v>And it came to pass, that he returned, having received the kingdom: and he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.16"><v id="16"></v>And the first came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.17"><v id="17"></v>And he said to him: Well done, thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful in a little, thou shalt have power over ten cities. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.18"><v id="18"></v>And the second came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.21"><v id="21"></v>For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.22"><v id="22"></v>He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.23"><v id="23"></v>And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming, I might have exacted it with usury? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.30"><v id="30"></v>Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath sitten: loose him, and bring him hither. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.31"><v id="31"></v>And if any man shall ask you: Why do you loose him? you shall say thus unto him: Because the Lord hath need of his service. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.32"><v id="32"></v>And they that were sent, went their way, and found the colt standing, as he had said unto them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.33"><v id="33"></v>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.34"><v id="34"></v>But they said: Because the Lord hath need of him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.35"><v id="35"></v>And they brought him to Jesus. And casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.36"><v id="36"></v>And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.37"><v id="37"></v>And when he was now coming near the descent of mount Olivet, the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.38"><v id="38"></v>Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory on high! </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.39"><v id="39"></v>And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him: Master, rebuke thy disciples. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.40"><v id="40"></v>To whom he said: I say to you, that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.41"><v id="41"></v>And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.42"><v id="42"></v>If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.44"><v id="44"></v>And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee: and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.45"><v id="45"></v>And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.19.46"><v id="46"></v>Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.10"><v id="10"></v>And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. Who, beating him, sent him away empty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.11"><v id="11"></v>And again he sent another servant. But they beat him also, and treating him reproachfully, sent him away empty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.12"><v id="12"></v>And again he sent the third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.13"><v id="13"></v>Then the lord of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be, when they see him, they will reverence him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.14"><v id="14"></v>Whom when the husbandmen saw, they thought within themselves, saying: This is the heir, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.15"><v id="15"></v>So casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.16"><v id="16"></v>He will come, and will destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. Which they hearing, said to him: God forbid. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.17"><v id="17"></v>But he looking on them, said: What is this then that is written, The stone, which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.18"><v id="18"></v>Whosoever shall fall upon that stone, shall be bruised: and upon whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.19"><v id="19"></v>And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him the same hour: but they feared the people, for they knew that he spoke this parable to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.20"><v id="20"></v>And being upon the watch, they sent spies, who should feign themselves just, that they might take hold of him in his words, that they might deliver him up to the authority and power of the governor. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.21"><v id="21"></v>And they asked him, saying: Master, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly: and thou dost not respect any person, but teachest the way of God in truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.22"><v id="22"></v>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.23"><v id="23"></v>But he considering their guile, said to them: Why tempt you me? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.24"><v id="24"></v>Shew me a penny. Whose image and inscription hath it? They answering, said to him, Caesar's. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.25"><v id="25"></v>And he said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's: and to God the things that are God's. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.26"><v id="26"></v>And they could not reprehend his word before the people: and wondering at his answer, they held their peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.27"><v id="27"></v>And there came to him some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, and they asked him, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.28"><v id="28"></v>Saying: Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he leave no children, that his brother should take her to wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.29"><v id="29"></v>There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.30"><v id="30"></v>And the next took her to wife, and he also died childless. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.31"><v id="31"></v>And the third took her. And in like manner all the seven, and they left no children, and died. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.32"><v id="32"></v>Last of all the woman died also. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.33"><v id="33"></v>In the resurrection therefore, whose wife of them shall she be? For all the seven had her to wife. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.34"><v id="34"></v>And Jesus said to them: The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.35"><v id="35"></v>But they that shall be accounted worthy of that world, and of the resurrection from the dead, shall neither be married, nor take wives. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.36"><v id="36"></v>Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.37"><v id="37"></v>Now that the dead rise again, Moses also shewed, at the bush, when he called the Lord, The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.38"><v id="38"></v>For he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.39"><v id="39"></v>And some of the scribes answering, said to him: Master, thou hast said well. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.40"><v id="40"></v>And after that they durst not ask him any more questions. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.41"><v id="41"></v>But he said to them: How say they that Christ is the son of David? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.42"><v id="42"></v>And David himself saith in the book of Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.43"><v id="43"></v>Till I make thy enemies thy footstool. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.44"><v id="44"></v>David then calleth him Lord: and how is he his son? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.45"><v id="45"></v>And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.46"><v id="46"></v>Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplace, and the first chairs in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.20.47"><v id="47"></v>Who devour the houses of widows, feigning long prayer. These shall receive greater damnation. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.21.5"><v id="5"></v>And some saying of the temple, that it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.21.8"><v id="8"></v>Who said: Take heed you be not seduced; for many will come in my name, saying, I am he; and the time is at hand: go ye not therefore after them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.21.9"><v id="9"></v>And when you shall hear of wars and seditions, be not terrified: these things must first come to pass; but the end is not yet presently. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.21.10"><v id="10"></v>Then he said to them: Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.21.11"><v id="11"></v>And there shall be great earthquakes in divers places, and pestilences, and famines, and terrors from heaven; and there shall be great signs. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.1"><v id="1"></v>NOW the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the pasch, was at hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.2"><v id="2"></v>And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death: but they feared the people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.3"><v id="3"></v>And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.4"><v id="4"></v>And he went, and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.5"><v id="5"></v>And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.6"><v id="6"></v>And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.7"><v id="7"></v>And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.8"><v id="8"></v>And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.10"><v id="10"></v>And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.11"><v id="11"></v>And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.12"><v id="12"></v>And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished; and there prepare. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.13"><v id="13"></v>And they going, found as he had said to them, and made ready the pasch. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.14"><v id="14"></v>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.15"><v id="15"></v>And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.16"><v id="16"></v>For I say to you, that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.17"><v id="17"></v>And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks, and said: Take, and divide it among you: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.18"><v id="18"></v>For I say to you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.19"><v id="19"></v>And taking bread, he gave thanks, and brake; and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.20"><v id="20"></v>In like manner the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.21"><v id="21"></v>But yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.22"><v id="22"></v>And the Son of man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.24"><v id="24"></v>And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.25"><v id="25"></v>And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that have power over them, are called beneficent. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.27"><v id="27"></v>For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is it not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.28"><v id="28"></v>And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.31"><v id="31"></v>And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.32"><v id="32"></v>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.33"><v id="33"></v>Who said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.34"><v id="34"></v>And he said: I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.35"><v id="35"></v>When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, did you want anything? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.36"><v id="36"></v>But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip; and he that hath not, let him sell his coat, and buy a sword. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.37"><v id="37"></v>For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me: And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.38"><v id="38"></v>But they said: Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.39"><v id="39"></v>And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.40"><v id="40"></v>And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.41"><v id="41"></v>And he was withdrawn away from them a stone's cast; and kneeling down, he prayed, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.42"><v id="42"></v>Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.43"><v id="43"></v>And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.44"><v id="44"></v>And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.45"><v id="45"></v>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.46"><v id="46"></v>And he said to them: Why sleep you? arise, pray, lest you enter into temptation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.47"><v id="47"></v>As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.48"><v id="48"></v>And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.49"><v id="49"></v>And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.50"><v id="50"></v>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.51"><v id="51"></v>But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.52"><v id="52"></v>And Jesus said to the chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.53"><v id="53"></v>When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.54"><v id="54"></v>And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest's house. But Peter followed afar off. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.55"><v id="55"></v>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.57"><v id="57"></v>But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.58"><v id="58"></v>And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.59"><v id="59"></v>And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him; for he is also a Galilean. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.60"><v id="60"></v>And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.61"><v id="61"></v>And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.62"><v id="62"></v>And Peter going out, wept bitterly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.63"><v id="63"></v>And the men that held him, mocked him, and struck him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.64"><v id="64"></v>And they blindfolded him, and smote his face. And they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that struck thee? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.65"><v id="65"></v>And blaspheming, many other things they said against him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.66"><v id="66"></v>And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people, and the chief priests and scribes, cane together; and they brought him into their council, saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.22.67"><v id="67"></v>And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.2"><v id="2"></v>And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.3"><v id="3"></v>And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, said: Thou sayest it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.4"><v id="4"></v>And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.5"><v id="5"></v>But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.6"><v id="6"></v>But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.7"><v id="7"></v>And when he understood that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem, in those days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.8"><v id="8"></v>And Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad; for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.9"><v id="9"></v>And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.10"><v id="10"></v>And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.11"><v id="11"></v>And Herod with his army set him at nought, and mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.12"><v id="12"></v>And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day; for before they were enemies one to another. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.13"><v id="13"></v>And Pilate, calling together the chief priests, and the magistrates, and the people, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.14"><v id="14"></v>Said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.15"><v id="15"></v>No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.16"><v id="16"></v>I will chastise him therefore, and release him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.17"><v id="17"></v>Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.18"><v id="18"></v>But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.19"><v id="19"></v>Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for a murder, was cast into prison. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.20"><v id="20"></v>And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.21"><v id="21"></v>But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.22"><v id="22"></v>And he said to them the third time: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore, and let him go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.23"><v id="23"></v>But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and their voices prevailed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.24"><v id="24"></v>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.25"><v id="25"></v>And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition, had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but Jesus he delivered up to their will. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.26"><v id="26"></v>And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.27"><v id="27"></v>And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.28"><v id="28"></v>But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.29"><v id="29"></v>For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the paps that have not given suck. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.30"><v id="30"></v>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us; and to the hills: Cover us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.31"><v id="31"></v>For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.32"><v id="32"></v>And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.33"><v id="33"></v>And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.34"><v id="34"></v>And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.35"><v id="35"></v>And the people stood beholding, and the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.36"><v id="36"></v>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.37"><v id="37"></v>And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.38"><v id="38"></v>And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.39"><v id="39"></v>And one of those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.40"><v id="40"></v>But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.41"><v id="41"></v>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no evil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.42"><v id="42"></v>And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.43"><v id="43"></v>And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me in paradise. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.44"><v id="44"></v>And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.45"><v id="45"></v>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.46"><v id="46"></v>And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.47"><v id="47"></v>Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.48"><v id="48"></v>And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.49"><v id="49"></v>And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.50"><v id="50"></v>And behold there was a man named Joseph, who was a counsellor, a good and just man, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.51"><v id="51"></v>(The same had not consented to their counsel and doings;) of Arimathea, a city of Judea; who also himself looked for the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.52"><v id="52"></v>This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.53"><v id="53"></v>And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.54"><v id="54"></v>And it was the day of the Parasceve, and the sabbath drew on. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.55"><v id="55"></v>And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after, saw the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.23.56"><v id="56"></v>And returning, they prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath day they rested, according to the commandment. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.1"><v id="1"></v>AND on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.2"><v id="2"></v>And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.3"><v id="3"></v>And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.4"><v id="4"></v>And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.5"><v id="5"></v>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.6"><v id="6"></v>He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was in Galilee, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.7"><v id="7"></v>Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.8"><v id="8"></v>And they remembered his words. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.9"><v id="9"></v>And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.10"><v id="10"></v>And it was Mary Magdalen, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.11"><v id="11"></v>And these words seemed to them as idle tales; and they did not believe them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.12"><v id="12"></v>But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves; and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.13"><v id="13"></v>And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.14"><v id="14"></v>And they talked together of all these things which had happened. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.15"><v id="15"></v>And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.16"><v id="16"></v>But their eyes were held, that they should not know him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.17"><v id="17"></v>And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk, and are sad? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.18"><v id="18"></v>And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.19"><v id="19"></v>To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.20"><v id="20"></v>And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.21"><v id="21"></v>But we hoped, that it was he that should have redeemed Israel: and now besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.22"><v id="22"></v>Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us, who before it was light, were at the sepulchre, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.23"><v id="23"></v>And not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.24"><v id="24"></v>And some of our people went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said, but him they found not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.25"><v id="25"></v>Then he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all things which the prophets have spoken. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.26"><v id="26"></v>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.27"><v id="27"></v>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures, the things that were concerning him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.28"><v id="28"></v>And they drew night to the town, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.29"><v id="29"></v>But they constrained him; saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.30"><v id="30"></v>And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.31"><v id="31"></v>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.32"><v id="32"></v>And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in this way, and opened to us the scriptures? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.33"><v id="33"></v>And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were staying with them, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.34"><v id="34"></v>Saying: The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.35"><v id="35"></v>And they told what things were done in the way; and how they knew him in the breaking of the bread. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.36"><v id="36"></v>Now whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them, and saith to them: Peace be to you; it is I, fear not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.37"><v id="37"></v>But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.38"><v id="38"></v>And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.39"><v id="39"></v>See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.40"><v id="40"></v>And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.41"><v id="41"></v>But while they yet believed not, and wondered for joy, he said: Have you any thing to eat? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.42"><v id="42"></v>And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.43"><v id="43"></v>And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.44"><v id="44"></v>And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.45"><v id="45"></v>Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.46"><v id="46"></v>And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, the third day: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.47"><v id="47"></v>And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.48"><v id="48"></v>And you are witnesses of these things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.49"><v id="49"></v>And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.50"><v id="50"></v>And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.51"><v id="51"></v>And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them, and was carried up to heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.52"><v id="52"></v>And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="42.24.53"><v id="53"></v>And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</bcv></p0>
