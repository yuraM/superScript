<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.2"><v id="2"></v>To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place of theirs and ours. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.3"><v id="3"></v>Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.4"><v id="4"></v>I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.5"><v id="5"></v>That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.6"><v id="6"></v>As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.7"><v id="7"></v>So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.8"><v id="8"></v>Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.9"><v id="9"></v>God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.10"><v id="10"></v>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that you be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.11"><v id="11"></v>For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.12"><v id="12"></v>Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I am of Cephas; and I of Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.13"><v id="13"></v>Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.14"><v id="14"></v>I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.15"><v id="15"></v>Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.16"><v id="16"></v>And I baptized also the household of Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.17"><v id="17"></v>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.18"><v id="18"></v>For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness; but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.19"><v id="19"></v>For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the prudence of the prudent I will reject. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.20"><v id="20"></v>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.21"><v id="21"></v>For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.22"><v id="22"></v>For both the Jews require signs, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.23"><v id="23"></v>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.24"><v id="24"></v>But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.25"><v id="25"></v>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.26"><v id="26"></v>For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.27"><v id="27"></v>But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise; and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.28"><v id="28"></v>And the base things of the world, and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen, and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.29"><v id="29"></v>That no flesh should glory in his sight. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.30"><v id="30"></v>But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and justice, and sanctification, and redemption: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.1.31"><v id="31"></v>That, as it is written: He that glorieth, may glory in the Lord. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.1"><v id="1"></v>AND I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.2"><v id="2"></v>For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.4"><v id="4"></v>And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.5"><v id="5"></v>That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.6"><v id="6"></v>Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.7"><v id="7"></v>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory : </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.8"><v id="8"></v>Which none of the princes of this world knew; for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.9"><v id="9"></v>But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.10"><v id="10"></v>But to us God hath revealed them, by this Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.11"><v id="11"></v>For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.12"><v id="12"></v>Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God; that we may know the things that are given us from God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.13"><v id="13"></v>Which things also we speak, not in the learned words of human wisdom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.14"><v id="14"></v>But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.15"><v id="15"></v>But the spiritual man judgeth all things; and he himself is judged of no man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.2.16"><v id="16"></v>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that we may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.2"><v id="2"></v>I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.3"><v id="3"></v>For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.4"><v id="4"></v>For while one saith, I indeed am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollo; are you not men ? What then is Apollo, and what is Paul? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.5"><v id="5"></v>The ministers of him whom you have believed; and to every one as the Lord hath given. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.6"><v id="6"></v>I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.7"><v id="7"></v>Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.8"><v id="8"></v>Now he that planteth, and he that watereth, are one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.9"><v id="9"></v>For we are God's coadjutors: you are God's husbandry; you are God's building. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.10"><v id="10"></v>According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.11"><v id="11"></v>For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.16"><v id="16"></v>Know you not, that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.17"><v id="17"></v>But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.18"><v id="18"></v>Let no man deceive himself: if any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.3.19"><v id="19"></v>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.2"><v id="2"></v>Here now it is required among the dispensers, that a man be found faithful. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.3"><v id="3"></v>But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you, or by man's day; but neither do I judge my own self. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.6"><v id="6"></v>But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes; that in us you may learn, that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.7"><v id="7"></v>For who distinguisheth thee ? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received ? And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.8"><v id="8"></v>You are now full; you are now become rich; you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.9"><v id="9"></v>For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death: we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.10"><v id="10"></v>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honourable, but we without honour. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.11"><v id="11"></v>Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no fixed abode; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.12"><v id="12"></v>And we labour, working with our own hands: we are reviled, and we bless; we are persecuted, and we suffer it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.13"><v id="13"></v>We are blasphemed, and we entreat; we are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all even until now. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.14"><v id="14"></v>I write not these things to confound you; but I admonish you as my dearest children. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.15"><v id="15"></v>For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.16"><v id="16"></v>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.17"><v id="17"></v>For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord; who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus; as I teach every where in every church. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.4.18"><v id="18"></v>As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.4"><v id="4"></v>The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body, but the wife. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.5"><v id="5"></v>Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer; and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.6"><v id="6"></v>But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.7"><v id="7"></v>For I would that all men were even as myself: but every one hath his proper gift from God; one after this manner, and another after that. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.8"><v id="8"></v>But I say to the unmarried, and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.9"><v id="9"></v>But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.10"><v id="10"></v>But to them that are married, not I but the Lord commandeth, that the wife depart not from her husband. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.11"><v id="11"></v>And if she depart, that she remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.12"><v id="12"></v>For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she consent to dwell with him, let him not put her away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.13"><v id="13"></v>And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not, and he consent to dwell with her, let her not put away her husband. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.14"><v id="14"></v>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife; and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband: otherwise your children should be unclean; but now they are holy. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.15"><v id="15"></v>But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.16"><v id="16"></v>For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband ? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.17"><v id="17"></v>But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one, so let him walk: and so in all churches I teach. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.18"><v id="18"></v>Is any man called, being circumcised ? let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.19"><v id="19"></v>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.20"><v id="20"></v>Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.21"><v id="21"></v>Wast thou called, being a bondman ? care not for it; but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.22"><v id="22"></v>For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.23"><v id="23"></v>You are bought with a price; be not made the bondslaves of men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.24"><v id="24"></v>Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.25"><v id="25"></v>Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.26"><v id="26"></v>I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity, that it is good for a man so to be. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.27"><v id="27"></v>Art thou bound to a wife ? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.28"><v id="28"></v>But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.29"><v id="29"></v>This therefore I say, brethren; the time is short; it remaineth, that they also who have wives, be as if they had none; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.30"><v id="30"></v>And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.31"><v id="31"></v>And they that use this world, as if they used it not: for the fashion of this world passeth away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.32"><v id="32"></v>But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife, is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.33"><v id="33"></v>But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.34"><v id="34"></v>And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world, how she may please her husband. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.35"><v id="35"></v>And this I speak for your profit: not to cast a snare upon you; but for that which is decent, and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.36"><v id="36"></v>But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured, with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will; he sinneth not, if she marry. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.37"><v id="37"></v>For he that hath determined being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will; and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.38"><v id="38"></v>Therefore, both he that giveth his virgin in marriage, doth well; and he that giveth her not, doth better. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.39"><v id="39"></v>A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband die, she is at liberty: let her marry to whom she will; only in the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.7.40"><v id="40"></v>But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel; and I think that I also have the spirit of God. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.1"><v id="1"></v>NOW concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up; but charity edifieth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.2"><v id="2"></v>And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.4"><v id="4"></v>But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.5"><v id="5"></v>For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many, and lords many); </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.6"><v id="6"></v>Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.7"><v id="7"></v>But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol: eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.8"><v id="8"></v>But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more; nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.9"><v id="9"></v>But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.10"><v id="10"></v>For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.11"><v id="11"></v>And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.12"><v id="12"></v>Now when you sin thus against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.8.13"><v id="13"></v>Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.9.9"><v id="9"></v>For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.9.10"><v id="10"></v>Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes? For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth, should plough in hope; and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.9.22"><v id="22"></v>To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I might save all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.9.23"><v id="23"></v>And I do all things for the gospel's sake: that I may be made partaker thereof. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.19"><v id="19"></v>For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.20"><v id="20"></v>When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord's supper. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.21"><v id="21"></v>For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.22"><v id="22"></v>What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not ? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.23"><v id="23"></v>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.24"><v id="24"></v>And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.25"><v id="25"></v>In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.26"><v id="26"></v>For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.27"><v id="27"></v>Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.28"><v id="28"></v>But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.29"><v id="29"></v>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.30"><v id="30"></v>Therefore are there many inform and weak among you, and many sleep. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.31"><v id="31"></v>But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.32"><v id="32"></v>But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.33"><v id="33"></v>Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.11.34"><v id="34"></v>If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.1"><v id="1"></v>NOW concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.2"><v id="2"></v>You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.3"><v id="3"></v>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.4"><v id="4"></v>Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.5"><v id="5"></v>And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.6"><v id="6"></v>And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.7"><v id="7"></v>And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.8"><v id="8"></v>To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.9"><v id="9"></v>To another, faith in the same spirit; to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.10"><v id="10"></v>To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of tongues; to another, interpretation of speeches. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.11"><v id="11"></v>But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.12"><v id="12"></v>For as the body is one, and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body, so also is Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.13"><v id="13"></v>For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.14"><v id="14"></v>For the body also is not one member, but many. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.15"><v id="15"></v>If the foot should say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.16"><v id="16"></v>And if the ear should say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.17"><v id="17"></v>If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.18"><v id="18"></v>But now God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.19"><v id="19"></v>And if they all were one member, where would be the body? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.20"><v id="20"></v>But now there are many members indeed, yet one body. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.21"><v id="21"></v>And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help; nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.22"><v id="22"></v>Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body, are more necessary. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.23"><v id="23"></v>And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour; and those that are our uncomely parts, have more abundant comeliness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.24"><v id="24"></v>But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.25"><v id="25"></v>That there might be no schism in the body; but the members might be mutually careful one for another. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.26"><v id="26"></v>And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it; or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.27"><v id="27"></v>Now you are the body of Christ, and members of member. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.28"><v id="28"></v>And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that miracles; then the graces of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.29"><v id="29"></v>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.12.30"><v id="30"></v>Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.6"><v id="6"></v>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.7"><v id="7"></v>Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped ? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.9"><v id="9"></v>So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said ? For you shall be speaking into the air. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.17"><v id="17"></v>For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.19"><v id="19"></v>But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also; than ten thousand words in a tongue. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.20"><v id="20"></v>Brethren, do not become children in sense: but in malice be children, and in sense be perfect. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.21"><v id="21"></v>In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.22"><v id="22"></v>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecies not to unbelievers, but to believers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.23"><v id="23"></v>If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad ? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.25"><v id="25"></v>The secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.26"><v id="26"></v>How is it then, brethren ? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.27"><v id="27"></v>If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course, and let one interpret. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.28"><v id="28"></v>But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church, and speak to himself and to God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.29"><v id="29"></v>And let the prophets speak, two or three; and let the rest judge. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.33"><v id="33"></v>For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.34"><v id="34"></v>Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law saith. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.14.35"><v id="35"></v>But if they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.32"><v id="32"></v>If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.33"><v id="33"></v>Be not seduced: Evil communications corrupt good manners. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.34"><v id="34"></v>Awake, ye just, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God, I speak it to your shame. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.35"><v id="35"></v>But some man will say: How do the dead rise again? or with what manner of body shall they come? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.36"><v id="36"></v>Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.37"><v id="37"></v>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be; but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.38"><v id="38"></v>But God giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.39"><v id="39"></v>All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.40"><v id="40"></v>And there are bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.41"><v id="41"></v>One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.42"><v id="42"></v>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.43"><v id="43"></v>It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory. It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.44"><v id="44"></v>It is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.45"><v id="45"></v>The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.46"><v id="46"></v>Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; afterwards that which is spiritual. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.47"><v id="47"></v>The first man was of the earth, earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.48"><v id="48"></v>Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.49"><v id="49"></v>Therefore as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.50"><v id="50"></v>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess incorruption. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.51"><v id="51"></v>Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.52"><v id="52"></v>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise again incorruptible: and we shall be changed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.53"><v id="53"></v>For this corruptible must put on incorruption; and this mortal must put on immortality. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.54"><v id="54"></v>And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.55"><v id="55"></v>O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.56"><v id="56"></v>Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.57"><v id="57"></v>But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.15.58"><v id="58"></v>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable; always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.1"><v id="1"></v>NOW concerning the collections that are made for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.2"><v id="2"></v>On the first day of the week let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him; that when I come, the collections be not then to be made. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.3"><v id="3"></v>And when I shall be with you, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.4"><v id="4"></v>And if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.5"><v id="5"></v>Now I will come to you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia. For I shall pass through Macedonia. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.6"><v id="6"></v>And with you perhaps I shall abide, or even spend the winter: that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.7"><v id="7"></v>For I will not see you now by the way, for I trust that I shall abide with you some time, if the Lord permit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.8"><v id="8"></v>But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.9"><v id="9"></v>For a great door and evident is opened unto me: and many adversaries. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.10"><v id="10"></v>Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear, for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.11"><v id="11"></v>Let no man therefore despise him, but conduct ye him on his way in peace: that he may come to me. For I look for him with the breatheren. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.12"><v id="12"></v>And touching our brother Apollo, I give you to understand, that I much entreated him to come unto you with the breatheren: and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time. But he will come when he shall have leisure. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.13"><v id="13"></v>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith,do manfully, and be strengthened. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.14"><v id="14"></v>Let all your things be done in charity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.15"><v id="15"></v>And I beseech you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanas, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the firstfruits of Achaia, and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.16"><v id="16"></v>That you also be subject to such, and to every one that worketh with us, and laboureth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.17"><v id="17"></v>And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because that which was wanting on your part, they have supplied. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.18"><v id="18"></v>For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours. Know them, therefore, that are such. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="46.16.19"><v id="19"></v>The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house, with whom I also lodge. </bcv></p0>
