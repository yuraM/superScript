<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.1"><v id="1"></v>THE beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.2"><v id="2"></v>As it is written in Isaias the prophet: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.3"><v id="3"></v>A voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.4"><v id="4"></v>John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remission of sins. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.5"><v id="5"></v>And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.6"><v id="6"></v>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.7"><v id="7"></v>And he preached, saying: There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.8"><v id="8"></v>I have baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.9"><v id="9"></v>And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.10"><v id="10"></v>And forthwith coming up out of he water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit as a dove descending, and remaining on him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.11"><v id="11"></v>And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.12"><v id="12"></v>And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.13"><v id="13"></v>And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan; and he was with beasts, and the angels ministered to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.14"><v id="14"></v>And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.15"><v id="15"></v>And saying: The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.16"><v id="16"></v>And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea (for they were fishermen). </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.17"><v id="17"></v>And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.18"><v id="18"></v>And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.19"><v id="19"></v>And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.20"><v id="20"></v>And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.21"><v id="21"></v>And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.22"><v id="22"></v>And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.23"><v id="23"></v>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.24"><v id="24"></v>Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.25"><v id="25"></v>And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.26"><v id="26"></v>And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.27"><v id="27"></v>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? what is this new doctrine? for with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.28"><v id="28"></v>And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.29"><v id="29"></v>And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.30"><v id="30"></v>And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.31"><v id="31"></v>And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.32"><v id="32"></v>And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.33"><v id="33"></v>And all the city was gathered together at the door. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.34"><v id="34"></v>And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases; and he cast out many devils, and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.35"><v id="35"></v>And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.36"><v id="36"></v>And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.37"><v id="37"></v>And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.38"><v id="38"></v>And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.39"><v id="39"></v>And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.40"><v id="40"></v>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down said to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.41"><v id="41"></v>And Jesus having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and touching him, saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.42"><v id="42"></v>And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.43"><v id="43"></v>And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.44"><v id="44"></v>And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.1.45"><v id="45"></v>But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places: and they flocked to him from all sides. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.1"><v id="1"></v>AND again he entered into Capharnaum after some days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.2"><v id="2"></v>And it was heard that he was in the house, and many came together, so that there was no room; no, not even at the door; and he spoke to them the word. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And they came to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, who was carried by four. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.4"><v id="4"></v>And when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was; and opening it, they let down the bed wherein the man sick of the palsy lay. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.5"><v id="5"></v>And when Jesus had seen their faith, he saith to the sick of the palsy: Son, thy sins are forgiven thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.6"><v id="6"></v>And there were some of the scribes sitting there, and thinking in their hearts: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.7"><v id="7"></v>Why doth this man speak thus? he blasphemeth. Who can forgive sins, but God only? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.8"><v id="8"></v>Which Jesus presently knowing in his spirit, that they so thought within themselves, saith to them: Why think you these things in your hearts? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.9"><v id="9"></v>Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy: Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.10"><v id="10"></v>But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.11"><v id="11"></v>I say to thee: Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.12"><v id="12"></v>And immediately he arose; and taking up his bed, went his way in the sight of all; so that all wondered and glorified God, saying: We never saw the like. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.13"><v id="13"></v>And he went forth again to the sea side; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.14"><v id="14"></v>And when he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alpheus sitting at the receipt of custom; and he saith to him: Follow me. And rising up, he followed him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.15"><v id="15"></v>And it came to pass, that as he sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat down together with Jesus and his disciples. For they were many, who also followed him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.16"><v id="16"></v>And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing that he ate with publicans and sinners, said to his disiples: Why doth your master eat and drink with publicans and sinners? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.17"><v id="17"></v>Jesus hearing this, saith to them: They that are well have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. For I came not to call the just, but sinners. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.18"><v id="18"></v>And the disiples of John and the Pharisees used to fast; and they come and say to him: Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast; but thy disciples do not fast? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.19"><v id="19"></v>And Jesus saith to them: Can the children of the marriage fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.20"><v id="20"></v>But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them; and then they shall fast in those days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.21"><v id="21"></v>No man seweth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment: otherwise the new piecing taketh away from the old, and there is made a greater rent. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.22"><v id="22"></v>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: otherwise the wine will burst the bottles, and both the wine will be spilled, and the bottles will be lost. But new wine must be put into new bottles. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.23"><v id="23"></v>And it came to pass again, as the Lord walked through the corn fields on the sabbath, that his disciples began to go forward, and to pluck the ears of corn. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.24"><v id="24"></v>And the Pharisees said to him: Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.25"><v id="25"></v>And he said to them: Have you never read what David did when he had need, and was hungry himself, and they that were with him? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.26"><v id="26"></v>How he went into the house of God, under Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the loaves of proposition, which was not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave to them who were with him? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.27"><v id="27"></v>And he said to them: The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.2.28"><v id="28"></v>Therefore the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.1"><v id="1"></v>AND he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.2"><v id="2"></v>And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days; that they might accuse him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.3"><v id="3"></v>And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Stand up in the midst. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.4"><v id="4"></v>And he saith to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy? But they held their peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.5"><v id="5"></v>And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.6"><v id="6"></v>And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.7"><v id="7"></v>But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.8"><v id="8"></v>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.9"><v id="9"></v>And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.10"><v id="10"></v>For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.11"><v id="11"></v>And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.12"><v id="12"></v>Thou art the Son of God. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.13"><v id="13"></v>And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.14"><v id="14"></v>And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.15"><v id="15"></v>And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.16"><v id="16"></v>And to Simon he gave the name Peter: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.17"><v id="17"></v>And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.18"><v id="18"></v>And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananean: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.19"><v id="19"></v>And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.20"><v id="20"></v>And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.21"><v id="21"></v>And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.22"><v id="22"></v>And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.23"><v id="23"></v>And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.24"><v id="24"></v>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.25"><v id="25"></v>And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.26"><v id="26"></v>And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.27"><v id="27"></v>No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then shall he plunder his house. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.28"><v id="28"></v>Amen I say to you, that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.29"><v id="29"></v>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.30"><v id="30"></v>Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.3.31"><v id="31"></v>And his mother and his bretheren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.2"><v id="2"></v>And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his doctrine: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.3"><v id="3"></v>Hear ye: Behold, the sower went out to sow. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.4"><v id="4"></v>And whilst he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate it up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.5"><v id="5"></v>And other some fell upon stony ground, where it had not much earth; and it shot up immediately, because it had no depth of earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.6"><v id="6"></v>And when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.7"><v id="7"></v>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.8"><v id="8"></v>And some fell upon good ground; and brought forth fruit that grew up, and increased and yielded, one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.9"><v id="9"></v>And he said: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.10"><v id="10"></v>And when he was alone, the twelve that were with him asked him the parable. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.11"><v id="11"></v>And he said to them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things are done in parables: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.12"><v id="12"></v>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand: lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.13"><v id="13"></v>And he saith to them: Are you ignorant of this parable? and how shall you know all parables? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.14"><v id="14"></v>He that soweth, soweth the word. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.15"><v id="15"></v>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown, and as soon as they have heard, immediately Satan cometh and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.16"><v id="16"></v>And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground: who when they have heard the word, immediately recieve it with joy. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.17"><v id="17"></v>And they have no root in themselves, but are only for a time: and then when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are presently scandalized. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.18"><v id="18"></v>And others there are who are sown among thorns: these are they that hear the word, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.19"><v id="19"></v>And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts after other things entering in choke the word, and it is made fruitless. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.20"><v id="20"></v>And these are they who are sown upon the good ground, who hear the word, and receive it, and yield fruit, the one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.21"><v id="21"></v>And he said to them: Doth a candle come in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.22"><v id="22"></v>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest: neither was it made secret, but that it may come abroad. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.23"><v id="23"></v>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.24"><v id="24"></v>And he said to them: Take heed what you hear. In what measure you shall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to you. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.26"><v id="26"></v>And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the earth, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.27"><v id="27"></v>And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow up whilst he knoweth not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.28"><v id="28"></v>For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.29"><v id="29"></v>And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.30"><v id="30"></v>And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or to what parable shall we compare it? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.31"><v id="31"></v>It is as a grain of mustard seed: which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.32"><v id="32"></v>And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air may dwell under the shadow thereof. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.33"><v id="33"></v>And with many such parables, he spoke to them the word, according as they were able to hear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.34"><v id="34"></v>And without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he explained all things to his disciples. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.35"><v id="35"></v>And he saith to them that day, when evening was come: Let us pass over to the other side. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.36"><v id="36"></v>And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in the ship: and there were other ships with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.37"><v id="37"></v>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was filled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.38"><v id="38"></v>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow; and they awake him, and say to him: Master, doth it not concern thee that we perish? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.39"><v id="39"></v>And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased: and there was made a great calm. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.4.40"><v id="40"></v>And he said to them: Why are you fearful? have you not faith yet? And they feared exceedingly: and they said one to another: Who is this (thinkest thou) that both wind and sea obey him? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.4"><v id="4"></v>For having been often bound with fetters and chains, he had burst the chains, and broken the fetters in pieces, and no one could tame him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.14"><v id="14"></v>And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the fields. And they went out to see what was done: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.18"><v id="18"></v>And when he went up into the ship, he that had been troubled with the devil, began to beseech him that he might be with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.19"><v id="19"></v>And he admitted him not, but saith to him: Go into thy house to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had mercy on thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.20"><v id="20"></v>And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men wondered. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.27"><v id="27"></v>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind him, and touched his garment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.28"><v id="28"></v>For she said: If I shall touch but his garment, I shall be whole. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.29"><v id="29"></v>And forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the evil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.30"><v id="30"></v>And immediately Jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had proceeded from him, turning to the multitude, said: Who hath touched my garments? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.31"><v id="31"></v>And his disciples said to him: Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou who hath touched me? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.36"><v id="36"></v>But Jesus having heard the word that was spoken, saith to the ruler of the synagogue: Fear not, only believe. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.5.37"><v id="37"></v>And he admitted not any man to follow him, but Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.3"><v id="3"></v>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joseph, and Jude, and Simon? are not also his sisters here with us? And they were scandalized in regard of him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.4"><v id="4"></v>And Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and in his own house, and among his own kindred. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.5"><v id="5"></v>And he could not do any miracles there, only that he cured a few that were sick, laying his hands upon them. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.8"><v id="8"></v>And he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, but a staff only: no scrip, no bread, nor money in their purse, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.9"><v id="9"></v>But to be shod with sandals, and that they should not put on two coats. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.13"><v id="13"></v>And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.14"><v id="14"></v>And king Herod heard, (for his name was made manifest,) and he said: John the Baptist is risen again from the dead, and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves in him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.17"><v id="17"></v>For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.18"><v id="18"></v>For John said to Herod: It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.20"><v id="20"></v>For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a just and holy man: and kept him, and when he heard him, did many things: and he heard him willingly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.21"><v id="21"></v>And when a convenient day was come, Herod made a supper for his birthday, for the princes, and tribunes, and chief men of Galilee. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.23"><v id="23"></v>And he swore to her: Whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give thee, though it be the half of my kingdom. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.34"><v id="34"></v>And Jesus going out saw a great multitude: and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.35"><v id="35"></v>And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, saying: This is a desert place, and the hour is now past: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.37"><v id="37"></v>And he answering said to them: Give you them to eat. And they said to him: Let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence, and we will give them to eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.38"><v id="38"></v>And he saith to them: How many loaves have you? go and see. And when they knew, they say: Five, and two fishes </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.39"><v id="39"></v>And he commanded them that they should make them all sit down by companies upon the green grass. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.41"><v id="41"></v>And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes: looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave to his disciples to set before them: and the two fishes he divided among them all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.42"><v id="42"></v>And they all did eat, and had their fill. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.48"><v id="48"></v>And seeing them labouring in rowing, (for the wind was against them,) and about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh to them walking upon the sea, and he would have passed by them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.49"><v id="49"></v>But they seeing him walking upon the sea, thought it was an apparition, and they cried out. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.50"><v id="50"></v>For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them: Have a good heart, it is I, fear ye not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.51"><v id="51"></v>And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased: and they were far more astonished within themselves: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.52"><v id="52"></v>For they understood not concerning the loaves; for their heart was blinded. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.53"><v id="53"></v>And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Genezareth, and set to the shore. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.54"><v id="54"></v>And when they were gone out of the ship, immediately they knew him: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.55"><v id="55"></v>And running through that whole country, they began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.6.56"><v id="56"></v>And whithersoever he entered, into towns or into villages or cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.4"><v id="4"></v>And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.5"><v id="5"></v>And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.6"><v id="6"></v>But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.7"><v id="7"></v>And in vain to they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.8"><v id="8"></v>For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.9"><v id="9"></v>And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.10"><v id="10"></v>For Moses said: Honor thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.18"><v id="18"></v>And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.19"><v id="19"></v>Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.20"><v id="20"></v>But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.21"><v id="21"></v>For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.22"><v id="22"></v>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.23"><v id="23"></v>All these evil things come from within, and defile a man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.24"><v id="24"></v>And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.25"><v id="25"></v>For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.26"><v id="26"></v>For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.27"><v id="27"></v>Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.28"><v id="28"></v>But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.29"><v id="29"></v>And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.30"><v id="30"></v>And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.31"><v id="31"></v>And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.32"><v id="32"></v>And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.33"><v id="33"></v>And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.34"><v id="34"></v>And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.35"><v id="35"></v>And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.36"><v id="36"></v>And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.7.37"><v id="37"></v>And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.8.3"><v id="3"></v>And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way; for some of them came from afar off. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.8.4"><v id="4"></v>And his disciples answered him: From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the wilderness? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.8.5"><v id="5"></v>And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? Who said: Seven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.8.6"><v id="6"></v>And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he broke, and gave to his disciples for to set before them; and they set them before the people. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.8.10"><v id="10"></v>And immediately going up into a ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.8.11"><v id="11"></v>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, asking him a sign from heaven, tempting him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.8.15"><v id="15"></v>And he charged them, saying: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.8.16"><v id="16"></v>And they reasoned among themselves, saying: Because we have no bread. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.8.23"><v id="23"></v>And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town; and spitting upon his eyes, laying his hands on him, he asked him if he saw any thing. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.24"><v id="24"></v>And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus again answering, saith to them: Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.25"><v id="25"></v>It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.26"><v id="26"></v>Who wondered the more, saying among themselves: Who then can be saved? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.27"><v id="27"></v>And Jesus looking on them, saith: With men it is impossible; but not with God: for all things are possible with God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.28"><v id="28"></v>And Peter began to say unto him: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.29"><v id="29"></v>Jesus answering, said: Amen I say to you, there is no man who hath left house or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.30"><v id="30"></v>Who shall not receive an hundred times as much, now in this time; houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions: and in the world to come life everlasting. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.31"><v id="31"></v>But many that are first, shall be last: and the last, first. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.32"><v id="32"></v>And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem: and Jesus went before them, and they were astonished; and following were afraid. And taking again the twelve, he began to tell them the things that should befall him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.33"><v id="33"></v>Saying: Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests, and to the scribes and ancients, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.34"><v id="34"></v>And they shall mock him, and spit on him, and scourge him, and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.35"><v id="35"></v>And James and John the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying: Master, we desire that whatsoever we shall ask, thou wouldst do it for us: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.36"><v id="36"></v>But he said to them: What would you that I should do for you? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.37"><v id="37"></v>And they said: Grant to us, that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.38"><v id="38"></v>And Jesus said to them: You know not what you ask. Can you drink of the chalice that I drink of: or be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.39"><v id="39"></v>But they said to him: We can. And Jesus saith to them: You shall indeed drink of the chalice that I drink of: and with the baptism wherewith I am baptized, you shall be baptized. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.40"><v id="40"></v>But to sit on my right hand, or on my left, is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.41"><v id="41"></v>And the ten hearing it, began to be much displeased at James and John. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.42"><v id="42"></v>But Jesus calling them, saith to them: You know that they who seem to rule over the Gentiles, lord it over them: and their princes have power over them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.43"><v id="43"></v>But it is not so among you: but whosoever will be greater, shall be your minister. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.44"><v id="44"></v>And whosoever will be first among you, shall be the servant of all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.45"><v id="45"></v>For the Son of man also is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.46"><v id="46"></v>And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho, with his disciples, and a very great multitude, Bartimeus the blind man, the son of Timeus, sat by the way side begging. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.47"><v id="47"></v>Who when he had heard, that it was Jesus of Nazareth, began to cry out, and to say: Jesus son of David, have mercy on me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.48"><v id="48"></v>And many rebuked him, that he might hold his peace; but he cried a great deal the more: Son of David, have mercy on me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.49"><v id="49"></v>And Jesus, standing still, commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him: Be of better comfort: arise, he calleth thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.50"><v id="50"></v>Who casting off his garment leaped up, and came to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.51"><v id="51"></v>And Jesus answering, said to him: What wilt thou that I should do to thee? And the blind man said to him: Rabboni, that I may see. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.10.52"><v id="52"></v>And Jesus saith to him: Go thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he saw, and followed him in the way. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.11.2"><v id="2"></v>And saith to them: Go into the village that is over against you, and immediately at your coming in thither, you shall find a colt tied, upon which no man yet hath sat: loose him, and bring him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.2"><v id="2"></v>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant to receive of the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.14"><v id="14"></v>Who coming, say to him: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and carest not for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar; or shall we not give it? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.19"><v id="19"></v>Master, Moses wrote unto us, that if any man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.20"><v id="20"></v>Now there were seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no issue. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.21"><v id="21"></v>And the second took her, and died: and neither did he leave any issue. And the third in like manner. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.22"><v id="22"></v>And the seven all took her in like manner; and did not leave issue. Last of all the woman also died. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.23"><v id="23"></v>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise again, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.24"><v id="24"></v>And Jesus answering, saith to them: Do ye not therefore err, because you know not the scriptures, nor the power of God? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.25"><v id="25"></v>For when they shall rise again from the dead, they shall neither marry, nor be married, but are as the angels in heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.26"><v id="26"></v>And as concerning the dead that they rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.28"><v id="28"></v>And there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning together, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him which was the first commandment of all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.29"><v id="29"></v>And Jesus answered him: The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel: the Lord thy God is one God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.30"><v id="30"></v>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind, and with thy whole strength. This is the first commandment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.31"><v id="31"></v>And the second is like to it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.32"><v id="32"></v>And the scribe said to him: Well, Master, thou hast said in truth, that there is one God, and there is no other besides him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.33"><v id="33"></v>And that he should be loved with the whole heart, and with the whole understanding, and with the whole soul, and with the whole strength; and to love one's neighbour as one's self, is a greater thing than all holocausts and sacrifices. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.34"><v id="34"></v>And Jesus seeing that he had answered wisely, said to him: Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.35"><v id="35"></v>And Jesus answering, said, teaching in the temple: How do the scribes say, that Christ is the son of David? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.36"><v id="36"></v>For David himself saith by the Holy Ghost: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.37"><v id="37"></v>David therefore himself calleth him Lord, and whence is he then his son? And a great multitude heard him gladly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.38"><v id="38"></v>And he said to them in his doctrine: Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in long robes, and to be saluted in the marketplace, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.39"><v id="39"></v>And to sit in the first chairs, in the synagogues, and to have the highest places at suppers: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.40"><v id="40"></v>Who devour the houses of widows under the pretence of long prayer: these shall receive greater judgment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.41"><v id="41"></v>And Jesus sitting over against the treasury, beheld how the people cast money into the treasury, and many that were rich cast in much. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.42"><v id="42"></v>And there came a certain poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.43"><v id="43"></v>And calling his disciples together, he saith to them: Amen I say to you, this poor widow hath cast in more than all they who have cast into the treasury. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.12.44"><v id="44"></v>For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want cast in all she had, even her whole living. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.13.19"><v id="19"></v>For in those days shall be such tribulations, as were not from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, neither shall be. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.1"><v id="1"></v>NOW the feast of the pasch, and of the Azymes was after two days; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him, and kill him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.2"><v id="2"></v>But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.3"><v id="3"></v>And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.4"><v id="4"></v>Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.5"><v id="5"></v>For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.6"><v id="6"></v>But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.7"><v id="7"></v>For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.8"><v id="8"></v>She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for burial. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.9"><v id="9"></v>Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memorial of her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.10"><v id="10"></v>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.11"><v id="11"></v>Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.12"><v id="12"></v>Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.13"><v id="13"></v>And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.14"><v id="14"></v>And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.15"><v id="15"></v>And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there prepare ye for us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.16"><v id="16"></v>And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.17"><v id="17"></v>And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.18"><v id="18"></v>And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.19"><v id="19"></v>But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.20"><v id="20"></v>Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.21"><v id="21"></v>And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.22"><v id="22"></v>And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and gave to them, and said: Take ye. This is my body. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.23"><v id="23"></v>And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.24"><v id="24"></v>And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.25"><v id="25"></v>Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.26"><v id="26"></v>And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.27"><v id="27"></v>And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in my regard this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.28"><v id="28"></v>But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.29"><v id="29"></v>But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.30"><v id="30"></v>And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to thee, to day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny me thrice. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.31"><v id="31"></v>But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.32"><v id="32"></v>And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.33"><v id="33"></v>And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.34"><v id="34"></v>And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.35"><v id="35"></v>And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.36"><v id="36"></v>And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.37"><v id="37"></v>And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? couldst thou not watch one hour? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.38"><v id="38"></v>Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.39"><v id="39"></v>A going away again, he prayed, saying the same words. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.40"><v id="40"></v>And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.41"><v id="41"></v>And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.42"><v id="42"></v>Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.43"><v id="43"></v>And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.44"><v id="44"></v>And he that betrayed him, had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold on him, and lead him away carefully. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.45"><v id="45"></v>And when he was come, immediately going up to him, he saith: Hail, Rabbi; and he kissed him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.46"><v id="46"></v>But they laid hands on him, and held him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.47"><v id="47"></v>An one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.48"><v id="48"></v>And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.49"><v id="49"></v>I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.50"><v id="50"></v>Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.51"><v id="51"></v>And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and they laid hold on him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.52"><v id="52"></v>But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.53"><v id="53"></v>And they brought Jesus to the high priest; and all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.54"><v id="54"></v>And Peter followed him from afar off, even into the court of the high priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.55"><v id="55"></v>And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.56"><v id="56"></v>For many bore false witness against him, and their evidences were not agreeing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.57"><v id="57"></v>And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.58"><v id="58"></v>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another not made with hands. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.59"><v id="59"></v>And their witness did not agree. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.60"><v id="60"></v>And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.61"><v id="61"></v>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou the Christ the Son of the blessed God? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.62"><v id="62"></v>And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming with the clouds of heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.63"><v id="63"></v>Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.64"><v id="64"></v>You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.65"><v id="65"></v>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him: Prophesy: and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.66"><v id="66"></v>Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.67"><v id="67"></v>And when she had seen Peter warming himself, looking on him she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.68"><v id="68"></v>But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.69"><v id="69"></v>And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.70"><v id="70"></v>But he denied again. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.71"><v id="71"></v>But he began to curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom you speak. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.14.72"><v id="72"></v>And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.1"><v id="1"></v>AND straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.2"><v id="2"></v>And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.3"><v id="3"></v>And the chief priests accused him in many things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.4"><v id="4"></v>And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? behold in how many things they accuse thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.5"><v id="5"></v>But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.6"><v id="6"></v>Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.7"><v id="7"></v>And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.8"><v id="8"></v>And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.9"><v id="9"></v>And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.10"><v id="10"></v>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.11"><v id="11"></v>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.12"><v id="12"></v>And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.13"><v id="13"></v>But they again cried out: Crucify him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.14"><v id="14"></v>And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.15"><v id="15"></v>And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.16"><v id="16"></v>And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.17"><v id="17"></v>And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.18"><v id="18"></v>And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.19"><v id="19"></v>And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.20"><v id="20"></v>And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.21"><v id="21"></v>And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.22"><v id="22"></v>And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.23"><v id="23"></v>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.34"><v id="34"></v>And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.42"><v id="42"></v>And when evening was now come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,) </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.43"><v id="43"></v>Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.15.44"><v id="44"></v>But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.2"><v id="2"></v>And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.3"><v id="3"></v>And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.4"><v id="4"></v>And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.5"><v id="5"></v>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.6"><v id="6"></v>Who saith to them: Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.7"><v id="7"></v>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.8"><v id="8"></v>But they going out, fled from the sepulchre. For a trembling and fear had seized them: and they said nothing to any man; for they were afraid. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.9"><v id="9"></v>But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalen, out of whom he had cast seven devils. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.10"><v id="10"></v>She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.11"><v id="11"></v>And they hearing that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.12"><v id="12"></v>And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.13"><v id="13"></v>And they going told it to the rest: neither did they believe them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.14"><v id="14"></v>At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.15"><v id="15"></v>And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.16"><v id="16"></v>He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be condemned. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.17"><v id="17"></v>And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.18"><v id="18"></v>They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.19"><v id="19"></v>And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="41.16.20"><v id="20"></v>But they going forth preached every where: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.</bcv></p0>
