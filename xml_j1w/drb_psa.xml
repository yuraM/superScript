<p0><bcv bcv="19.68.3"><v id="3"></v>I stick fast in the mire of the deep: and there is no sure standing. I am come into the depth of the sea: and a tempest hath overwhelmed me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="19.68.4"><v id="4"></v>I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse: my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="19.68.5"><v id="5"></v>They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate me without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: then did I pay that which I took not away. </bcv></p0>
