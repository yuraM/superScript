<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.2"><v id="2"></v>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ Jesus, who are at Colossa. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.3"><v id="3"></v>Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. We give thanks to God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.4"><v id="4"></v>Hearing your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which you have towards all the saints. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.5"><v id="5"></v>For the hope that is laid up for you in heaven, which you have heard in the word of the truth of the gospel, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.6"><v id="6"></v>Which is come unto you, as also it is in the whole world, and bringeth forth fruit and groweth, even as it doth in you, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.7"><v id="7"></v>As you learned of Epaphras, our most beloved fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ Jesus; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.8"><v id="8"></v>Who also hath manifested to us your love in the spirit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.9"><v id="9"></v>Therefore we also, from the day that we heard it, cease not to pray for you, and to beg that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom, and spiritual understanding: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.10"><v id="10"></v>That you may walk worthy of God, in all things pleasing; being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.11"><v id="11"></v>Strengthened with all might, according to the power of his glory, in all patience and longsuffering with joy, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.12"><v id="12"></v>Giving thanks to God the Father, who hath made us worthy to be partakers of the lot of the saints in light: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.13"><v id="13"></v>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.14"><v id="14"></v>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.15"><v id="15"></v>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.16"><v id="16"></v>For in him were all things created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him and in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.17"><v id="17"></v>And he is before all, and by him all things consist. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.18"><v id="18"></v>And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he may hold the primacy: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.19"><v id="19"></v>Because in him, it hath well pleased the Father, that all fullness should dwell; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.20"><v id="20"></v>And through him to reconcile all things unto himself, making peace through the blood of his cross, both as to the things that are on earth, and the things that are in heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.21"><v id="21"></v>And you, whereas you were some time alienated and enemies in mind in evil works: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.22"><v id="22"></v>Yet now he hath reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unspotted, and blameless before him: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.23"><v id="23"></v>If so ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and immoveable from the hope of the gospel which you have heard, which is preached in all the creation that is under heaven, whereof I Paul am made a minister. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.24"><v id="24"></v>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ, in my flesh, for his body, which is the church: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.25"><v id="25"></v>Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given me towards you, that I may fulfil the word of God: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.26"><v id="26"></v>The mystery which hath been hidden from ages and generations, but now is manifested to his saints, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.27"><v id="27"></v>To whom God would make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ, in you the hope of glory. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.28"><v id="28"></v>Whom we preach, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.1.29"><v id="29"></v>Wherein also I labour, striving according to his working which he worketh in me in power. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.2"><v id="2"></v>That their hearts may be comforted, being instructed in charity, and unto all riches of fulness of understanding, unto the knowledge of the mystery of God the Father and of Christ Jesus: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.3"><v id="3"></v>In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.4"><v id="4"></v>Now this I say, that no man may deceive you by loftiness of words. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.5"><v id="5"></v>For though I be absent in body, yet in spirit I am with you; rejoicing, and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith which is in Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.6"><v id="6"></v>As therefore you have received Jesus Christ the Lord, walk ye in him; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.7"><v id="7"></v>Rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the faith, as also you have learned, abounding in him in thanksgiving. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.9"><v id="9"></v>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.10"><v id="10"></v>And you are filled in him, who is the head of all principality and power: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.11"><v id="11"></v>In whom also you are circumcised with circumcision not made by hand, in despoiling of the body of the flesh, but in the circumcision of Christ: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.12"><v id="12"></v>Buried with him in baptism, in whom also you are risen again by the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him up from the dead. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.13"><v id="13"></v>And you, when you were dead in your sins, and the uncircumcision of your flesh; he hath quickened together with him, forgiving you all offences: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.14"><v id="14"></v>Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the cross: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.15"><v id="15"></v>And despoiling the principalities and powers, he hath exposed them confidently in open shew, triumphing over them in himself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.16"><v id="16"></v>Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.17"><v id="17"></v>Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.18"><v id="18"></v>Let no man seduce you, willing in humility, and religion of angels, walking in the things which he hath not seen, in vain puffed up by the sense of his flesh, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.19"><v id="19"></v>And not holding the head, from which the whole body, by joints and bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth unto the increase of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.20"><v id="20"></v>If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world, why do you yet decree as though living in the world? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.21"><v id="21"></v>Touch not, taste not, handle not: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.22"><v id="22"></v>Which all are unto destruction by the very use, according to the precepts and doctrines of men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="51.2.23"><v id="23"></v>Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and humility, and not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of the flesh. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="51.3.12"><v id="12"></v>Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy, and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience: </bcv></p0>
