<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.1"><v id="1"></v>In the beginning God created heaven, and earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.2"><v id="2"></v>And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.3"><v id="3"></v>And God said: Be light made. And light was made. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.4"><v id="4"></v>And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.5"><v id="5"></v>And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.6"><v id="6"></v>And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.7"><v id="7"></v>And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.8"><v id="8"></v>And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.9"><v id="9"></v>God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.10"><v id="10"></v>And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.11"><v id="11"></v>And he said: Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.12"><v id="12"></v>And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.13"><v id="13"></v>And the evening and the morning were the third day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.14"><v id="14"></v>And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.15"><v id="15"></v>To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth. And it was so done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.16"><v id="16"></v>And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.17"><v id="17"></v>And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.18"><v id="18"></v>And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.19"><v id="19"></v>And the evening and morning were the fourth day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.20"><v id="20"></v>God also said: Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.21"><v id="21"></v>And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.22"><v id="22"></v>And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.23"><v id="23"></v>And the evening and morning were the fifth day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.24"><v id="24"></v>And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.25"><v id="25"></v>And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.26"><v id="26"></v>And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.27"><v id="27"></v>And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.28"><v id="28"></v>And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.29"><v id="29"></v>And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.30"><v id="30"></v>And to all the beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.1.31"><v id="31"></v>And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.1"><v id="1"></v>So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.2"><v id="2"></v>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.4"><v id="4"></v>These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.5"><v id="5"></v>And every plant of the field before it spring up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.6"><v id="6"></v>But a spring rose out the earth, watering all the surface of the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.7"><v id="7"></v>And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.8"><v id="8"></v>And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.9"><v id="9"></v>And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.10"><v id="10"></v>And a river went out the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.11"><v id="11"></v>The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.12"><v id="12"></v>And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.13"><v id="13"></v>And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.14"><v id="14"></v>And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.15"><v id="15"></v>And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise for pleasure, to dress it, and keep it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.16"><v id="16"></v>And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.17"><v id="17"></v>But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. for in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.18"><v id="18"></v>And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.19"><v id="19"></v>And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.20"><v id="20"></v>And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.21"><v id="21"></v>Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.22"><v id="22"></v>And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.23"><v id="23"></v>And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.24"><v id="24"></v>Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.2.25"><v id="25"></v>And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.1"><v id="1"></v>Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.2"><v id="2"></v>And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.3"><v id="3"></v>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.4"><v id="4"></v>And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.5"><v id="5"></v>For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.6"><v id="6"></v>And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband who did eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.7"><v id="7"></v>And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.8"><v id="8"></v>And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.9"><v id="9"></v>And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.10"><v id="10"></v>And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.11"><v id="11"></v>And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.12"><v id="12"></v>And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.13"><v id="13"></v>And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.14"><v id="14"></v>And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and the beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.15"><v id="15"></v>I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.16"><v id="16"></v>To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.17"><v id="17"></v>And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.18"><v id="18"></v>Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou eat the herbs of the earth. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.20"><v id="20"></v>And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.21"><v id="21"></v>And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife, garments of skins, and clothed them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.22"><v id="22"></v>And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.23"><v id="23"></v>And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.3.24"><v id="24"></v>And he cast out Adam; and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.4.3"><v id="3"></v>And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.4.4"><v id="4"></v>Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.4.5"><v id="5"></v>But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceedingly angry, and his countenance fell. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.4.10"><v id="10"></v>And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.4.14"><v id="14"></v>Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy face, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: everyone, therefore, that findeth me, shall kill me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.4.15"><v id="15"></v>And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not be so: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.19.2"><v id="2"></v>And said: I beseech you, my lords, turn in to the house of your servant, and lodge there: wash your feet, and in the morning you shall go on your way. And they said: No, but we will abide in the street. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.19.3"><v id="3"></v>He pressed them very much to turn in unto him: and when they were come in to his house, he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread and they ate: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.19.15"><v id="15"></v>And when it was- morning, the angels pressed him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and the two daughters which thou hast: lest thou also perish in the wickedness of the city. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.19.16"><v id="16"></v>And as he lingered, they took his hand, and the hand of his wife, and of his two daughters, because the Lord spared him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.19.17"><v id="17"></v>And they brought him forth, and set him without the city: and there they spoke to him, saying : Save thy life : look not back, neither stay thou in all the country about: but save thyself in the mountain, lest thou be also consumed. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.20.11"><v id="11"></v>Abraham answered: I thought with myself, saying: Perhaps there is not the fear of God in this place: and they will kill me for the sake of my wife: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.20.12"><v id="12"></v>Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my sister, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother, and I took her to wife. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.20.13"><v id="13"></v>And after God brought me out of my father's house, I said to her: I Thou shalt do me this kindness: In every place, to which we shall come, thou shalt say that I am thy brother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.20.14"><v id="14"></v>And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham: and restored to him Sara, his wife. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.20.15"><v id="15"></v>And said: The land is before you, dwell wheresoever it shall please thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.20.16"><v id="16"></v>And to Sara he said: Behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that are with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go: and remember thou wast taken. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.20.17"><v id="17"></v>And when Abraham prayed, God healed Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bore children: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.20.18"><v id="18"></v>For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech on ac- count of Sara, Abraham's wife. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.1"><v id="1"></v>And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised: and fulfilled what he had spoken. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.2"><v id="2"></v>And she conceived and bore a son in her old age, at the time that God had foretold her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.3"><v id="3"></v>And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sara bore him, Isaac. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.4"><v id="4"></v>And he circumcised him the eighth day, as God had commanded him, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.5"><v id="5"></v>When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father was Isaac born. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.6"><v id="6"></v>And Sara said: God hath made a laughter for me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.7"><v id="7"></v>And again she said: Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him in his old age. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.8"><v id="8"></v>And the child grew and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.9"><v id="9"></v>And when Sara had seen the son of Agar the Egyptian playing with Isaac her son, she said to Abraham: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.10"><v id="10"></v>Cast out this bondwoman, and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.11"><v id="11"></v>Abraham took this grievously for his son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.12"><v id="12"></v>And God said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.13"><v id="13"></v>But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.14"><v id="14"></v>So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.15"><v id="15"></v>And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.16"><v id="16"></v>And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.17"><v id="17"></v>And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not: for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.18"><v id="18"></v>Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand: for I will make him a great nation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.19"><v id="19"></v>And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.20"><v id="20"></v>And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.21"><v id="21"></v>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.22"><v id="22"></v>At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou dost. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.23"><v id="23"></v>Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.24"><v id="24"></v>And Abraham said: I will swear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.25"><v id="25"></v>And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.26"><v id="26"></v>And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till to day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.27"><v id="27"></v>And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.28"><v id="28"></v>And Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.29"><v id="29"></v>And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set apart? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.30"><v id="30"></v>But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe lambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.31"><v id="31"></v>Therefore that place was called Bersabee: because both of them did swear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.32"><v id="32"></v>And they made a league for the well of oath. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.21.33"><v id="33"></v>And Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army arose and returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.22.2"><v id="2"></v>He said to him: Take thy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision: and there thou shalt offer him for a holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will show thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.22.3"><v id="3"></v>So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled his ass: and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the holocaust he went his way to the place which God had commanded him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.22.4"><v id="4"></v>And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.22.5"><v id="5"></v>And he said to his young men: Stay you here with the ass: I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped, will return to you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.22.6"><v id="6"></v>And he took the wood for the holocaust, and laid it upon Isaac his son: and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as they two went on together, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.22.8"><v id="8"></v>And Abraham said: God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they went on together. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.22.9"><v id="9"></v>And they came to the place which God had shown him, where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it: and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.22.10"><v id="10"></v>And he put forth his hand and took the sword, to sacrifice his son. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.22.12"><v id="12"></v>And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.22.13"><v id="13"></v>Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram amongst the briers sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.23.4"><v id="4"></v>I am a stranger and sojourner among you: give me the right of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.23.9"><v id="9"></v>That he may give me the double cave, which he hath in the end of his field: for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me before you, for a possession of a buryingplace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.23.10"><v id="10"></v>Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron made answer to Abraham in the hearing of all that went in at the gate of the city, saying: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.23.13"><v id="13"></v>And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence of the people: I beseech thee to hear me: I will give money for the field: take it, and so I will bury my dead in it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.23.14"><v id="14"></v>And Ephron answered: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.16"><v id="16"></v>An exceedingly comely maid, and a most beautiful virgin, and not known to man: and she went down to the spring, and filled her pitcher and was coming back. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.31"><v id="31"></v>And said to him: Come in, thou blessed of the Lord: why standest thou without? I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.40"><v id="40"></v>The Lord, said he, in whose sight I walk, will send his angel with thee, and will direct thy way: and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my own kindred, and of my father's house. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.41"><v id="41"></v>But thou shalt be clear from my curse, when thou shalt come to my kindred, if they will not give thee one. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.42"><v id="42"></v>And I came to day to the well of water, and said: O Lord God of my master Abraham, if thou hast prospered my way, wherein I now walk, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.43"><v id="43"></v>Behold I stand by the well of water, and the virgin, that shall come out to draw water, who shall hear me say: Give me a little water to drink of thy pitcher: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.44"><v id="44"></v>And shall say to me: Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for my master's son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.45"><v id="45"></v>And whilst I pondered these things secretly with myself, Rebecca appeared coming with a pitcher, which she carried on her shoulder: and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her: Give me a little to drink. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.46"><v id="46"></v>And she speedily let down the pitcher from her shoulder, and said to me: Both drink thou, and to thy camels I will give drink. I drank, and she watered the camels. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.47"><v id="47"></v>And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him. So I put earrings on her to adorn her face, and I put bracelets on her hands. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.48"><v id="48"></v>And falling down I adored the Lord, blessing the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath brought me the straight way to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.49"><v id="49"></v>Wherefore if you do according to mercy and truth with my master, tell me: but if it please you otherwise, tell me that also, that I may go to the right hand, or to the left. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.50"><v id="50"></v>And Laban and Bathuel answered: The word hath proceeded from the Lord, we cannot speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.51"><v id="51"></v>Behold Rebecca is before thee, take her and go thy way, and let her be the wife of thy master's son, as the Lord hath spoken. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.52"><v id="52"></v>WHich when Abraham's servant heard, falling down to the ground he adored the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.53"><v id="53"></v>And bringing forth vessels of silver and gold, and garments, he gave them to Rebecca for a present. He offered gifts also to her brothers, and to her mother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.54"><v id="54"></v>And a banquet was made, and they ate and drank together, and lodged there. And in the morning, the servant arose, and said: Let me depart, that I may go to my master. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.55"><v id="55"></v>And her brother and mother answered: Let the maid stay at least ten days with us, and afterwards she shall depart. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.56"><v id="56"></v>Stay me not, said he, because the Lord hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.57"><v id="57"></v>And they said: Let us call the maid, and ask her will. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.58"><v id="58"></v>And they called her, and when she was come, they asked: Wilt thou go with this man? She said: I will go. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.59"><v id="59"></v>So they sent her away, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his company, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.60"><v id="60"></v>Wishing prosperity to their sister, and saying: Thou art our sister, mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands, and may thy seed possess the gates of their enemies. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.61"><v id="61"></v>So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon camels, followed the man: who with speed returned to his master. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.62"><v id="62"></v>At the same time Isaac was walking along the way to the well which is called Of the living and the seeing: for he dwelt in the south country. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.63"><v id="63"></v>And he was gone forth to meditate in the field, the day being now well spent: and when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming afar off. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.64"><v id="64"></v>Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted off the camel, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.65"><v id="65"></v>And said to the servant: Who is that man who cometh towards us along the field? And he said to her: That man is my master. But she quickly took her cloak, and covered herself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.66"><v id="66"></v>And the servant told Isaac all that he had done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.24.67"><v id="67"></v>Who brought her into the tent of Sara his mother, and took her to wife: and he loved her so much, that it moderated the sorrow which was occasioned by his mother's death. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.1"><v id="1"></v>And when a famine came in the land, after that barrenness which had happened in the days of Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Palestines to Gerara. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.2"><v id="2"></v>And the Lord appeared to him and said: Go not down into Egypt, but stay in the land that I shall tell thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.3"><v id="3"></v>And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries, to fulfill the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.4"><v id="4"></v>And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.5"><v id="5"></v>Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts and commandments, and observed my ceremonies and laws. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.6"><v id="6"></v>So Isaac abode in Gerara. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.7"><v id="7"></v>And when he was asked by the men of that place, concerning his wife, he answered: She is my sister; for he was afraid to confess that she was his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would like him because of her beauty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.8"><v id="8"></v>And when very many days were passed, and he abode there, Abimelech king of the Palestines looking out through a window, saw him playing with Rebecca his wife. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.9"><v id="9"></v>And calling for him, he said: It is evident she is thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be thy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should die for her sake. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.10"><v id="10"></v>And Abimelech said: Why hadst thou deceived us? Some man of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin. And he commanded all the people, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.11"><v id="11"></v>He that shall touch this man's wife, shall surely be put to death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.12"><v id="12"></v>And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same year a hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.13"><v id="13"></v>And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering and increasing, till he became exceeding great: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.14"><v id="14"></v>And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very great family. Wherefore the Palestines envying him, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.15"><v id="15"></v>Stopped up at that time all the wells, that the servants of his father Abraham had digged, filling them up with earth: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.16"><v id="16"></v>Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.17"><v id="17"></v>So he departed and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell there: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.18"><v id="18"></v>And he digged again other wells, which the servants of his father Abraham had digged, and which, after his death, the Palestines had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same names by which his father before had called them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.19"><v id="19"></v>And they digged in the torrent, and found living water. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.20"><v id="20"></v>But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is our water. Wherefore he called the name of the well, on occasion of that which had happened, Calumny. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.21"><v id="21"></v>And they digged also another; and for that they quarreled likewise, and he called the name of it, Enmity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.22"><v id="22"></v>Going forward from thence, he digged another well, for which they contended not: therefore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying: Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us to increase upon the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.23"><v id="23"></v>And he went up from that place to Bersabee, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.24"><v id="24"></v>Where the Lord appeared to him that same might, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy father; do not fear, for I am with thee: I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.25"><v id="25"></v>And he built there an altar: and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent: and commanded his servants to dig a well. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.28"><v id="28"></v>And they answered: We saw that the Lord is with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be an oath between us, and let us make a covenant, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.29"><v id="29"></v>That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing of thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee: but with peace have sent thee away increased with the blessing of the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.30"><v id="30"></v>And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.31"><v id="31"></v>Arising in the morning, they swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own home. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.26.34"><v id="34"></v>And Esau being forty years old, married wives, Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hethite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon of the same place. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.14"><v id="14"></v>He went, and brought, and gave them to his mother. She dressed meats, such as she knew his father liked. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.22"><v id="22"></v>He came near to his father, and when he had felt him, Isaac said: The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob; but the hands are the hands of Esau. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.32"><v id="32"></v>And Isaac said to him: Why! who art thou? He answered: I am thy firstborn son Esau. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.33"><v id="33"></v>Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished exceedingly: and wondering beyond what can be believed, said Who is he then the even now brought me venison that he had taken, and I ate of all before thou camest? and I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.34"><v id="34"></v>Esau having heard his father's words, roared out with a great cry: and being in a great consternation, said: Bless me also, my father. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.35"><v id="35"></v>And he said: Thy brother came deceitfully and got thy blessing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.36"><v id="36"></v>But he said again: Rightly is his name called Jacob; for he hath supplanted me lo this second time: my first birthright he took away before, and now this second time he hath stolen away my blessing. And again he said to his father: Hast thou not reserved me also a blessing? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.37"><v id="37"></v>Isaac answered: I have appointed him thy lord, and have made all his brethren his servants: I have established him with corn and wine, and after this, what shall I do more for thee, my son? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.38"><v id="38"></v>And Esac said to him: Hast thou only one blessing, father? I beseech thee bless me also. And when he wept with a loud cry, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.39"><v id="39"></v>Isaac being moved, said to him: In the fat of the earth, and in the dew of heaven from above, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.40"><v id="40"></v>Shall thy blessing be. Thou shalt live by the sword and shalt serve thy brother: and the time shall come, when thou shalt shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.41"><v id="41"></v>Esau therefore always hated Jacob for the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him: and he said in his heart: The days will come of the mourning of my father, and I will kill my brother Jacob. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.42"><v id="42"></v>These things were told to Rebecca: and she sent and called Jacob her son, and said to him: Behold Esau thy brother threateneth to kill thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.43"><v id="43"></v>Now therefore, my son, hear my voice: arise and flee to Laban my brother to Haran: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.44"><v id="44"></v>And thou shalt dwell with him a few days, till wrath of thy brother be assuaged, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.45"><v id="45"></v>And his indignation cease, and he forget the things thou hast done to him: afterwards I will send, and bring thee from thence hither. Why shall I be deprived of both my sons in one day? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.27.46"><v id="46"></v>And Rebecca said to Isaac: I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the stock of this land, I choose not to live. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.1"><v id="1"></v>And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, saying: Take not a wife of the stock of Chanaan: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.2"><v id="2"></v>But go, and take a journey to Mesopotamia of Syria, to the house of Bathuel thy mother's father, and take thee a wife thence of the daughters of Laban thy uncle. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.3"><v id="3"></v>And God almighty bless thee, and make thee to increase, and multiply thee: that thou mayst be a multitude of people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.4"><v id="4"></v>And give the blessings of Abrabam to thee, and to thy seed after thee: that thou mayst possess the land of thy sojournment, which he promised to thy grandfather. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.8"><v id="8"></v>Experiencing also that his father was not well pleased with the daughters of Chanaan: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.9"><v id="9"></v>He went to Ismael, and took to wife, besides them he had before, Maheleth the daughter of Ismael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nabajoth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.10"><v id="10"></v>But Jacob being departed from Bersabee, went on to Haran. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.11"><v id="11"></v>And when he was come to a certain place, and would rest in it after sunset, he took of the stones that lay there, and putting under his head, slept in the same place. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.12"><v id="12"></v>And he saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the earth, and the top thereof touching heaven: the angels also of God ascending and descending by it; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.13"><v id="13"></v>And the Lord leaning upon the ladder, saying to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land, wherein thou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.14"><v id="14"></v>And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and IN THEE and thy seed all the tribes of the earth SHALL BE BLESSED. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.16"><v id="16"></v>And when Jacob awaked out of sleep, he said: Indeed the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.17"><v id="17"></v>And trembling he said: How terrible is this place! this is no other but the house of God, and the gate of heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.28.18"><v id="18"></v>And Jacob, arising in the morning, took the stone, which he had laid under his head, and set it up for a title, pouring oil upon the top of it. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.1"><v id="1"></v>Then Jacob went on in his journey, and came into the east country. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.2"><v id="2"></v>And he saw a well in the field, and three flocks of sheep lying by it: for the beasts were watered out of it, and the mouth thereof was closed with a great stone. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.3"><v id="3"></v>And the custom was, when all the sheep were gathered together to roll away the stone, and after the sheep were watered, to put it on the mouth of the well again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.4"><v id="4"></v>And he said to the shepherds: Brethren, whence are you? They answered: Of Haran. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.5"><v id="5"></v>And he asked them, saying: Know you Laban the son of Nachor? They said: We know him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.6"><v id="6"></v>He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say they: and behold Rachel his daughter cometh with his flock. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.7"><v id="7"></v>And Jacob said: There is yet much day remaining, neither is it time to bring the flocks into the folds again: first give the sheep drink, and so lead them back to feed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.8"><v id="8"></v>They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle be gathered together, and we remove the stone from the well's mouth, that we may water the flocks. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.9"><v id="9"></v>They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she fed the flock. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.10"><v id="10"></v>And when Jacob saw her, and knew her to be his cousin-german, and that they were the sheep of Laban, his uncle: he removed the stone wherewith the well was closed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.11"><v id="11"></v>And having watered the flock, he kissed her: and lifting up his voice, wept. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.12"><v id="12"></v>And he told her that he was her father's brother, and the son of Rebecca: but she went in haste and told her father. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.13"><v id="13"></v>Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister's son was come, ran forth to meet him; and embracing him, and heartily kissing him, brought him into his house. And when he had heard the causes of his journey, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.14"><v id="14"></v>He answered: Thou art my bone and my flesh. And after the days of one month were expired, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.15"><v id="15"></v>He said to him: Because thou art my brother, shalt thou serve me without wages? Tell me what wages thou wilt have. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.16"><v id="16"></v>Now he had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lia: and the younger was called Richel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.17"><v id="17"></v>But Lia was blear eyed: Rachel was well favoured, and of a beautiful countenance. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.18"><v id="18"></v>And Jacob being in love with her, said: I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.19"><v id="19"></v>Lahan answered: It is better that I give her thee than to another man; stay with me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.20"><v id="20"></v>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel: and they seemed but a few days, because of the greatness of his love. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.21"><v id="21"></v>And he said to Laban: Give me my wife; for now the time is fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.22"><v id="22"></v>And he, having invited a great number of his friends to the feast, made the marriage. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.23"><v id="23"></v>And at night he brought in Lia his daughter to him, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.24"><v id="24"></v>Giving his daughter a handmaid, named Zalpha. Now when Jacob had gone in to her according to custom when morning was come he saw it was Lia: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.25"><v id="25"></v>And he said to his father in law: What is it that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve thee for Rachel? why hast thou deceived me? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.26"><v id="26"></v>Laban answered: It is not the custom in this place, to give the younger in marriage first. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.27"><v id="27"></v>Make up the week of days of this match: and I will give thee her also, for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.28"><v id="28"></v>He yielded to his pleasure: and after the week was past, he married Rachel: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.30"><v id="30"></v>And having at length obtained the marriage he wished for, he preferred the love of the latter before the former, and served with him other seven years. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.31"><v id="31"></v>And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia, opened her womb, but her sister remained barren. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.32"><v id="32"></v>And she conceived and bore a son, and called his name Ruben, saying: The Lord saw my affliction: now my husband will love me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.33"><v id="33"></v>And again she conceived and bore a son, and said: Because the Lord heard that I was despised, he hath given this also to me: and she called his name Simeon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.34"><v id="34"></v>And she conceived the third time, and bore another son: and said: Now also my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons: and therefore she called hi sname Levi. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.29.35"><v id="35"></v>The fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and said: now will I praise the Lord: and for this she called him Juda. And she left bearing. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.15"><v id="15"></v>She answered: Dost thou think it a small matter, that thou hast taken my husband from me, unless thou take also my son's mandrakes? Rachel said: He shall sleep with thee this night, for thy son's mandrakes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.16"><v id="16"></v>And when Jacob returned at even from the field, Lia went out to meet him, and said: Thou shalt come in unto me, because I have hired thee for my son's mandrakes. And he slept with her that night. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.31"><v id="31"></v>And Laban said: What shall I give thee? But he said: I require nothing: but if thou wilt do what I demand, I will feed, and keep thy sheep again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.32"><v id="32"></v>Go round through all thy flocks, and separate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled: and all that is brown and spotted, and of divers colours, as well among the sheep, as among the goats, shall be my wages. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.33"><v id="33"></v>And my justice shall answer for me to morrow before thee when the time of the bargain shall come: and all that is not of divers colours, and spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall accuse me of theft. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.35"><v id="35"></v>And he separated the name day the she goats, and the sheep, and the he goats, and the rams of divers colours, and spotted: and all the flock of one colour, that is, of white and black fleece, he delivered into the hands of his sons. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.36"><v id="36"></v>And he set the space of three days' journey betwixt himself and his son in law, who fed the rest of his flock. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.37"><v id="37"></v>And Jacob took green robs of poplar, and of almond, and of place trees, and pilled them in part: so when the bark was taken off, in the parts that were pilled, there appeared whiteness: but the parts that were whole remained green: and by this means the colour was divers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.38"><v id="38"></v>And he put them in the troughs, where the water was poured out: that when the flocks should come to drink, they might have the rods before their eyes, and in the sight of them might conceive. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.39"><v id="39"></v>And it came to pass that in the very heat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and brought forth spotted, and of divers colours, and speckled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.40"><v id="40"></v>And Jacob separated the flock, and put the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams: and all the white and the black were Laban's: and the rest were Jacob's, when the flocks were separated one from the other. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.41"><v id="41"></v>So when the ewes went first to ram, Jacob put the rods in the roughs of water before the eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they might conceive while they were looking upon them: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.30.42"><v id="42"></v>But when the latter coming was, and the last conceiving, he did not put them. And those that were late ward, become Laban's: and they of the first time, Jacob's. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.10"><v id="10"></v>For after that time came of the ewes conceiving, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep that the males which leaped upon the females were of diverse colors, and spotted, and speckled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.11"><v id="11"></v>And the angel of God said to me in my sleep: Jacob? And I answered: Here I am. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.12"><v id="12"></v>And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that all the males leaping upon the females, are of divers colors, spotted, and speckled. For I have seen all that Laban hath done to thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.13"><v id="13"></v>I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst anoint the stone, and make a vow to me. Now therefore arise, and go out of this land, and return into thy native country. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.14"><v id="14"></v>And Rachel and Lia answered: Have we anything left among the goods and inheritance of our father's house? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.15"><v id="15"></v>Hath he not counted us as strangers and sold us, and eaten up the price of us? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.16"><v id="16"></v>But God hath taken our father's riches, and delivered them to us, and to our children: wherefore do all that God hath commanded thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.17"><v id="17"></v>Then Jacob rose up, and having set his children and wives upon camels, went his way. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.18"><v id="18"></v>And he took all his substance, and flocks, and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and went forward to Isaac his father to the land of Chanaan. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.19"><v id="19"></v>At that time Laban was gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole away her father's idols. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.20"><v id="20"></v>And Jacob would not confess to his father in law that he was flying away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.21"><v id="21"></v>And when he was gone, together with all that belonged to him, and having passed the river, was going on towards mount Galaad, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.22"><v id="22"></v>It was told Laban on the third day that Jacob fled. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.23"><v id="23"></v>And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days; and overtook him in the mount of Galaad. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.24"><v id="24"></v>And he saw in a dream God saying to him: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.25"><v id="25"></v>Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and when he with his brethren had overtaken him, he pitched his tent in the same mount of Galaad. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.26"><v id="26"></v>And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done thus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my daughters, as captives taken with the sword. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.27"><v id="27"></v>Why wouldst thou run away privately and not acquaint me, that I might have brought thee on the way with joy, and with songs, and with timbrels, and with harps? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.28"><v id="28"></v>Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters: thou hast done foolishly: and now, indeed, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.29"><v id="29"></v>It is in my power to return thee evil: but the God of your father said to me yesterday: Take heed thou speak not any things harshly against Jacob. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.30"><v id="30"></v>Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends, and hadst a longing after thy father's house: why hast thou stolen away my gods? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.31"><v id="31"></v>Jacob answered: That I departed unknown to thee, it was for fear lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by force. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.32"><v id="32"></v>But whereas thou chargest me with theft: with whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods, let him be slain before our brethren. Search, and if thou find any of thy things with me, take them away. Now when he said this, he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.33"><v id="33"></v>So Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and found them not. And when he was entered into Rachel's tent, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.34"><v id="34"></v>She in haste hid the idols under the camel's furniture, and sat upon them: and when he had searched all the tent, and found nothing, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.35"><v id="35"></v>She said: Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee, because it has now happened to me, according to the custom of women, So his careful search was in vain. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.36"><v id="36"></v>And jacob being angry, said in a chiding manner: For what fault of mine, and for what offense on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.37"><v id="37"></v>And searched all my household stuff? What hast thou found of all the substance of thy house? lay it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and let them judge between me and thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.38"><v id="38"></v>Have I therefore been with thee twenty years? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the rams of thy flocks I did not eat: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.39"><v id="39"></v>Neither did I show thee that which the beast had torn, I made good all the damage: whatsoever was lost by theft, thou didst exact it of me: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.40"><v id="40"></v>Day and night was I parched with heat, and with frost, and sleep departed from my eyes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.41"><v id="41"></v>And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daughters, and six for thy flocks: thou hast changed also my wages ten times. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.42"><v id="42"></v>Unless the God of my father Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had stood by me, peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked: God beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesterday. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.43"><v id="43"></v>Laban answered him: The daughters are mine and the children, and thy flocks, and all things that thou seest are mine: what can I do to my children, and grandchildren? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.44"><v id="44"></v>Come therefore, let us enter into a league: that it may be for a testimony between me and thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.45"><v id="45"></v>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a title: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.46"><v id="46"></v>And he said to his brethren: Bring hither stones. And they gathering stones together, made a heap, and they ate upon it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.47"><v id="47"></v>And Laban called it The witness heap: and Jacob, The hillock of testimony: each of them according to the propriety of his language. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.48"><v id="48"></v>And Laban said: This heap shall be a witness between me and thee this day, and therefore the name thereof was called Galaad, that is, The witness heap. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.49"><v id="49"></v>The Lord behold and judge between us when we shall be gone one from the other. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.50"><v id="50"></v>If thou afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in other wives over them: none is witness of our speech but God, who is present and beholdeth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.51"><v id="51"></v>And he said again to Jacob: Behold, this heap, and the stone which I have set up between me and thee, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.52"><v id="52"></v>Shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and the stone, be they for a testimony, if either I shall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou shalt pass beyond it, thinking harm to me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.53"><v id="53"></v>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nachor, the God of their father, judge between us. And jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.54"><v id="54"></v>And after he had offered sacrifices in the mountain, he called his brethren to eat bread. And when they had eaten, they lodged there: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.31.55"><v id="55"></v>But laban arose in the night, and kissed his sons, and daughters, and blessed them: and returned to his place. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.1"><v id="1"></v>Jacob also went on the journey he had begun: and the angels of God met him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.2"><v id="2"></v>And when he saw them, he said: These are the camps of God, and he called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, Camps. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.3"><v id="3"></v>And he sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir to the country of Edom: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.4"><v id="4"></v>And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy brother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and have been with him until this day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.5"><v id="5"></v>I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants, and womenservants: and now I send a message to my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.6"><v id="6"></v>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to Esau thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.7"><v id="7"></v>Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.8"><v id="8"></v>Saying: If Esau come to one company and destroy it, the other company that is left shall escape. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.9"><v id="9"></v>And Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, who saidst to me: Return to thy land and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.10"><v id="10"></v>I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.11"><v id="11"></v>Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him: lest perhaps he come, and kill the mother with the children. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.12"><v id="12"></v>Thou didst say that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for the multitude. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.13"><v id="13"></v>And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.14"><v id="14"></v>Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.15"><v id="15"></v>Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten of their foals. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.16"><v id="16"></v>And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.17"><v id="17"></v>And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.18"><v id="18"></v>Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's: he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau: and he cometh after us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.19"><v id="19"></v>In like manner he commanded the second and the third, and all that followed with the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.20"><v id="20"></v>And ye shall add: thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us: for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.21"><v id="21"></v>So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in the camp. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.22"><v id="22"></v>And rising early he took his two wives, and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.23"><v id="23"></v>And when all things were brought over that belonged to him, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.24"><v id="24"></v>He remained alone: and behold a man wrestled with him till morning. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.25"><v id="25"></v>And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.26"><v id="26"></v>And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day. He answered: I will not let thee go except thou bless me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.27"><v id="27"></v>And he said: What is thy name? He answered: Jacob. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.28"><v id="28"></v>But he said: Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel: for if thou hast been strong against God, how much more shalt thou prevail against men? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.29"><v id="29"></v>Jacob asked him, Tell me by what name art thou called? He answered: Why dost thou ask my name? And he blessed him in the same place. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.30"><v id="30"></v>And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.31"><v id="31"></v>And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.32.32"><v id="32"></v>Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob's thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.1"><v id="1"></v>And Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming, and with him four hundred men: and he divided the children of Lia, and of Rachel, and of the two handmaids: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.2"><v id="2"></v>And he put both the handmaids and their children foremost: and Lia and her children in the second place: and Rachel and Joseph last. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.3"><v id="3"></v>And he went forward and bowed down with his face to the ground seven times until his brother came near. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.4"><v id="4"></v>Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and embraced him: and clasping him fast about the neck, and kissing him, wept. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.5"><v id="5"></v>And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women and their children, and said: What mean these? And do they belong to thee? He answered: They are the children which God hath given to me thy servant. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.6"><v id="6"></v>Then the handmaids and their children came near, and bowed themselves. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.8"><v id="8"></v>And Esau said: What are the droves that I met? He answered: That I might find favor before my lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.9"><v id="9"></v>But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep what is thine for thyself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.10"><v id="10"></v>And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee, but if I have found favor in thy eyes, receive a little present at my hands: for I have seen thy face, as if I should have seen the countenance of God: be gracious to me, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.11"><v id="11"></v>And take the blessing, which I have brought thee, and which God hath given me, who giveth all things. He took it with much ado at his brother's earnest pressing him, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.12"><v id="12"></v>And said: Let us go on together, and I will accompany thee in thy journey. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.13"><v id="13"></v>And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest that I have with me tender children, and sheep, and kine with young: which if I should cause to be overdriven, in one day all the flocks will die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.14"><v id="14"></v>May it please my lord to go before his servant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall see my children to be able, until I come to my lord in Seir. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.15"><v id="15"></v>Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some of the people at least, who are with me, may stay to accompany thee in the way. And he said: There is no necessity: I want nothing else but only to find favor, my lord, in thy sight. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.16"><v id="16"></v>So Esau returned, that day, the way that he came, to Seir. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.17"><v id="17"></v>And Jacob came to Socoth: where having built a house, and pitched tents, he called the name of the place Socoth, that is, Tents. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.33.18"><v id="18"></v>And he passed over to Salem, a city of the Sichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and he dwelt by the town: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.34.9"><v id="9"></v>And let us contract marriages one with another: give us your daughters and take you our daughters, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.34.22"><v id="22"></v>One thing there is for which so great a good is deferred: We must circumcise every male among us, following the manner of the nation. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.2"><v id="2"></v>And Jacob having called together all his household, said: Cast away the strange gods that are among you, and be cleansed and change your garments. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.3"><v id="3"></v>Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we may make there an altar to God: who heard me in the day of my affliction, and accompanied me in my journey. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.4"><v id="4"></v>So they gave him all the strange gods they had, and the earrings which were in their ears: and he buried them under the turpentine tree, that is behind the city of Sichem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.5"><v id="5"></v>And when they were departed, the terror of God fell upon all the cities round about, and they durst not pursue after them as they went away. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.7"><v id="7"></v>And he built there an altar, and called the name of that place, The house of God: for there God appeared to him when he fled from his brother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.8"><v id="8"></v>At the same time Debora the nurse of Rebecca died, and was buried at the foot of Bethel under an oak: and the name of that place was called, The oak of weeping. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.12"><v id="12"></v>And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.18"><v id="18"></v>And when her soul was departing for pain, and death was now at hand, she called the name of her son Benoni, that is, The son of my pain: but his father called him Benjamin, that is, The son of the right hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.19"><v id="19"></v>So Rachel died, and was buried in the highway that leadeth to Ephrata, that is Bethlehem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.20"><v id="20"></v>And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepulcher: this is the pillar of Rachel's monument, to this day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.21"><v id="21"></v>Departing thence, he pitched his tent beyond the Flock tower. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.35.22"><v id="22"></v>And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben went, and slept with Bala, the concubine of his father: which he was not ignorant of. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.2"><v id="2"></v>And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the dock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of and of Zelpha his father's wives : and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.3"><v id="3"></v>Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.4"><v id="4"></v>And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.5"><v id="5"></v>Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.6"><v id="6"></v>And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.7"><v id="7"></v>I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, end stood, and your sheaves standing about, bowed down before my sheaf. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.8"><v id="8"></v>His brethren answered : Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.9"><v id="9"></v>He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.10"><v id="10"></v>And when he had told this to his father and brethren, his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.11"><v id="11"></v>His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.12"><v id="12"></v>And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their father's docks, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.13"><v id="13"></v>Israel said to him : Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.14"><v id="14"></v>I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.15"><v id="15"></v>And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.16"><v id="16"></v>But he answered: I seek my brethren; tell me where they feed the docks. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.17"><v id="17"></v>And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.18"><v id="18"></v>And when they saw him afar off, be- fore he came nigh them, they thought to kill him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.20"><v id="20"></v>Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit : and we will say : Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him : </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.21"><v id="21"></v>And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, end said: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.22"><v id="22"></v>Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.23"><v id="23"></v>And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.24"><v id="24"></v>And cast him into an old pit, where there was no water. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.25"><v id="25"></v>And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Calaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.26"><v id="26"></v>And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.27"><v id="27"></v>It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.28"><v id="28"></v>And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.29"><v id="29"></v>And Ruben, returning to the pit, found not the boy: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.30"><v id="30"></v>And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear and whither shall I go? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.31"><v id="31"></v>And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed : </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.32"><v id="32"></v>Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.33"><v id="33"></v>And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.34"><v id="34"></v>And tearing his garments, he put an sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.35"><v id="35"></v>And alibis children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.37.36"><v id="36"></v>The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the soldiers. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.16"><v id="16"></v>And going to her, he said: Suffer me to lie with thee: for he knew her not to be his daughter in law. And she answered: What wilt thou give me to en joy my company? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.17"><v id="17"></v>He said: I will send thee a kid out of the flock. And when she said again: I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.18"><v id="18"></v>Juda said: What wilt thou have for a pledge ? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet, and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand. The woman therefore at one copulation conceived. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.19"><v id="19"></v>And she arose and went her way: and putting off the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.20"><v id="20"></v>And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the Odollamite, that he might receive the pledge again, which he had given to the woman: but he, not finding her, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.21"><v id="21"></v>asked the men of that place : Where is the woman that sat in the cross way? And when they all made answer: There was no harlot in this place, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.22"><v id="22"></v>He returned to Juda, and said to him: I have not found her; moreover the men of that place said to me, that there never sat a harlot there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.23"><v id="23"></v>Juda said : Let her take it to herself ; surely she cannot charge us with a,lie: I sent the kid which I promised: and thou didst not find her. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.24"><v id="24"></v>And behold after three months they told a lie, saying: Thamar, thy daughter in law hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to have a big belly. And Juda said : Bring her out that she may be burnt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.25"><v id="25"></v>But when she was led to execution, she sent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.26"><v id="26"></v>But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She is juster than I: because I did not give her to Sela, my son. However, he knew her no more. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.27"><v id="27"></v>And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.38.29"><v id="29"></v>But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth: and the woman said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and therefore called his name Phares. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.39.4"><v id="4"></v>And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered to him: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.39.5"><v id="5"></v>And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake, and multiplied all his substance, both at home, and in the fields. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.39.6"><v id="6"></v>Neither knew he any other thing, but the bread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance, and comely to behold. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.39.8"><v id="8"></v>But he, in no wise consenting to that wicked act, said to her: Behold, my master hath delivered all things to me, and knoweth not what he hath in his own house: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.39.9"><v id="9"></v>Neither is there any thing which is hot in my power, or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife : how then can I do this wicked thing, and I sin against my God? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.39.10"><v id="10"></v>With such words as these day by day, both the woman was importunate with the young man, and he refused the adultery. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.39.11"><v id="11"></v>Now it happened on it certain day, that Joseph went into the house, and was doing some business without any, man with him: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.39.12"><v id="12"></v>And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went out. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.39.14"><v id="14"></v>She called to her the men of her house, and said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me : and when I cried out, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.39.16"><v id="16"></v>For a proof therefore of her fidelity, she kept the garment, and shewed it to her husband when he returned home: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.1"><v id="1"></v>After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.2"><v id="2"></v>And Pharao being angry with them (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker) </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.3"><v id="3"></v>He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.4"><v id="4"></v>But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.5"><v id="5"></v>And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.6"><v id="6"></v>And when Joseph was come in to them in the morning, and saw them sad, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.7"><v id="7"></v>He asked them, saying: Why is your oountenance sadder to day than usual? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.8"><v id="8"></v>They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: Both not interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed.  </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.9"><v id="9"></v>The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.10"><v id="10"></v>On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes : </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.11"><v id="11"></v>And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.12"><v id="12"></v>Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches are yet three days: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.13"><v id="13"></v>After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shah present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou wast wont to do. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.14"><v id="14"></v>Only remember me, when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.15"><v id="15"></v>For I was stolen away out of the land I of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.16"><v id="16"></v>The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I bed three baskets of meal upon my heed: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.17"><v id="17"></v>And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.18"><v id="18"></v>Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three baskets are yet three days: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.19"><v id="19"></v>After which Pharao will take thy hand from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.20"><v id="20"></v>The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao: and he made a. great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.40.21"><v id="21"></v>And he restored the one to his place to present him the cup: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.1"><v id="1"></v>After two years Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood by the river, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.2"><v id="2"></v>Out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.3"><v id="3"></v>Other seven also came up out of the river, ill favoured, and leanfleshed: and they fed on the very bank of the river, in green places: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.4"><v id="4"></v>And they devoured them, whose bodies were very beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao awoke. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.5"><v id="5"></v>He slept again, and dreamed another dream: Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.6"><v id="6"></v>Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.7"><v id="7"></v>And devoured all the beauty of the former. Pharao awaked after his rest: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.8"><v id="8"></v>And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men: and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that could interpret it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.9"><v id="9"></v>Then at length the chief butler remembering, said: I confess my sin: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.10"><v id="10"></v>The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.11"><v id="11"></v>Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.12"><v id="12"></v>There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same captain of the soldiers: to whom we told our dreams, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.13"><v id="13"></v>And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so. For I was restored to my office: and he was hanged upon a gibbet. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.14"><v id="14"></v>Forthwith at the king's command, Joseph was brought out of the prison, and they shaved him, and changing his apparel, brought him in to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.15"><v id="15"></v>And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that can expound them: Now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.16"><v id="16"></v>Joseph answered: Without me, God shall give Pharao a prosperous answer. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.17"><v id="17"></v>So Pharao told what he had dreamed: Methought I stood upon the bank of the river, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.18"><v id="18"></v>And seven kine came up out of the river exceeding beautiful and full of flesh: and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.19"><v id="19"></v>And behold, there followed these, other seven kine, so very ill favoured and lean, that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.20"><v id="20"></v>And the devoured and consumed the former, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.21"><v id="21"></v>And yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as lean and ill favoured as before. I awoke, and then fell asleep again, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.22"><v id="22"></v>And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn grew upon one stalk, full and very fair. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.23"><v id="23"></v>Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stock: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.24"><v id="24"></v>And they devoured the beauty of the former: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and there is no man that can expound it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.25"><v id="25"></v>Joseph answered: The king's dream is one: God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to do. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.26"><v id="26"></v>The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of the dream. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.27"><v id="27"></v>And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind, are seven years of famine to come: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.28"><v id="28"></v>Which shall be fulfilled in this order: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.29"><v id="29"></v>Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of Egypt: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.30"><v id="30"></v>After which shall follow other seven years of so great scacity, that all the abundance before shall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume all the land, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.31"><v id="31"></v>And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of the plenty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.32"><v id="32"></v>And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of God cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.33"><v id="33"></v>Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man, and make him ruler over the land of Egypt: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.34"><v id="34"></v>That he may appoint overseers over all the countries: and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful years, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.35"><v id="35"></v>That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up under Pharao's hands and be reserved in the cities. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.36"><v id="36"></v>And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come, which shall oppress Egypt, and the land shall not consumed with scarcity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.37"><v id="37"></v>The counsel pleased Pharao and all his servants. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.38"><v id="38"></v>And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit of God? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.39"><v id="39"></v>He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.40"><v id="40"></v>Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey: only in the kingly throne will I be above thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.41"><v id="41"></v>And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.42"><v id="42"></v>And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.43"><v id="43"></v>And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made govenor over the whole land of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.44"><v id="44"></v>And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao; without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.45"><v id="45"></v>And he turned his name, and called him in the Eyyptian tounge, The saviour of the world. And he gave him to wife Asenth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis. Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.46"><v id="46"></v>(Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao) and he went round all the countries of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.47"><v id="47"></v>And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the corm being bound up into sheaves was gathered together into the barns of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.48"><v id="48"></v>And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.49"><v id="49"></v>And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.50"><v id="50"></v>And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born: whom Aseneth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis bore unto him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.51"><v id="51"></v>And he called the name of the first born Manasses, saying: God hath made me to forget all my labours, and my father's house. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.52"><v id="52"></v>And he named the second Epharaim, saying: God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.53"><v id="53"></v>Now when the seven years of the plenty that had been in Egypt were past: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.54"><v id="54"></v>The seven years of scarcity, which Joseph had foretold, began to come: and the famine prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread in all the land of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.55"><v id="55"></v>And when there also they began to be famished, the people cried to Pharao for food. And he said to them: Go to Joseph: and do all that he shall say to you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.56"><v id="56"></v>And the famine increased daily in all the land: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold to the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed them also. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.41.57"><v id="57"></v>And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and to seek some relief of their want. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.1"><v id="1"></v>And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt, said to his sons: Why are ye careless? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.2"><v id="2"></v>I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt: go ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we may live, and not be consumed with want. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.3"><v id="3"></v>So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to buy corn in Egypt: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.12"><v id="12"></v>And he answered them: It is otherwise: you are come to consider the unfenced parts of this land. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.13"><v id="13"></v>But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan: the youngest is with our father, the other is not living. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.14"><v id="14"></v>He saith: This is it that I said: You are spies. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.15"><v id="15"></v>I shall now presently try what you are: by the health of Pharao you shall not depart hence, until your youngest brother come. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.16"><v id="16"></v>Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in prison, till what you have said be proved, whether it be true or false: or else by the health of Pharao you are spies. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.17"><v id="17"></v>So he put them in prison three days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.18"><v id="18"></v>And the third day he brought them out of prison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall live: for I fear God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.19"><v id="19"></v>If you be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be bound in prison: and go ye your ways and carry the corn that you have bought, unto your houses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.20"><v id="20"></v>And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may find your words to be true, and you may not die. They did as he had said. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.21"><v id="21"></v>And they talked one to another: We deserve to suffer these things, because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguished of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this affliction come upon us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.22"><v id="22"></v>And Ruben one of them, said: Did not I say to you: Do not sin against the boy: and you would not hear me? Behold his blood is required. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.23"><v id="23"></v>And they knew not that Joseph understood, because he spoke to them by an interpreter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.24"><v id="24"></v>And he turned himself away a little while, and wept: and returning he spoke to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.25"><v id="25"></v>And taking Simeon, and binking him in their presence, he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put every man's money again in their sacks, and to give them besides provisions for the way: and they did so. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.26"><v id="26"></v>But they having loaded their asses with the corn, went their way. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.27"><v id="27"></v>And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast provender in the inn, saw the money in the sack's mouth; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.28"><v id="28"></v>And said to his brethren: My money is given me again, hehold it is in the sack. And thye were astonished, and troubled, and said to one another: What is this that God hath done unto us? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.29"><v id="29"></v>And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Chanaan, and they told him all things that had befallen them, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.30"><v id="30"></v>The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the country. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.31"><v id="31"></v>And we answered him: We are peaceable men, and we mean no plot. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.32"><v id="32"></v>We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living, the youngest is with our father in the land of Chanaan. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.33"><v id="33"></v>And he said to us: Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men: Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provision for your houses, and go your ways. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.34"><v id="34"></v>And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.35"><v id="35"></v>When they had told this, they poured out their corn and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being astonished together, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.36"><v id="36"></v>Their father Jacob said: You have made me to be without children: Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will take away: all these evils are fallen upon me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.37"><v id="37"></v>And Ruben answered him: Kill my two sons if I bring him not again to thee: deliver him unto my hand, and I will restore him to thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.42.38"><v id="38"></v>But he said: My son shall not go down with you: his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to hell. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.2"><v id="2"></v>And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons: Go again and buy us a little food. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.3"><v id="3"></v>Juda answered: The man declared unto us with the atteststion of an oath, saying: You shall not see my face, unless you bring your youngest brother with you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.4"><v id="4"></v>If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set out together, and will buy necessaries for thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.5"><v id="5"></v>But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the man, as we have often said, declared unto us, saying: You shall not see my face without your youngest brother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.6"><v id="6"></v>Israel said to them: You have done this for my misery in that you told him you had also another brother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.7"><v id="7"></v>But they answered: The man asked us in order concerning our kindred: if our father lived: if we had a brother: and we answered him regularly, according to what he demanded: Bring hither your brother with you? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.8"><v id="8"></v>And Juda said to his father: Send the bou with me, that we may set forward, and may live: lest both we and our children perish. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.9"><v id="9"></v>I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand: unless I bring him again, and restore him to thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.10"><v id="10"></v>If delay had not been made, we had been here again the second time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.11"><v id="11"></v>Then Israel said to them: If it must needs be so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down presents to the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax, myrrh, turpentine, and almonds. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.12"><v id="12"></v>And take with you double money, and carry back what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps it was done by mistake. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.13"><v id="13"></v>And take also your brother, and go to the man. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.14"><v id="14"></v>And may my almighty Bod make him favourable to you; and send back with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin: and as for me I shall be desolate without children. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.15"><v id="15"></v>So the men took the presents, and double money, and Benjamin: and went down into Egypt, and stood before Joseph. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.16"><v id="16"></v>And when he had seen them, and Benjamin with them, he commanded the steward of his house, saying: Bring in the men into the house, and kill victims, and prepare a feast: because they shall eat with me at noon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.17"><v id="17"></v>He did as he was commanded, and brought the men into the house.\ </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.18"><v id="18"></v>And they being much afraid, said there one to another: Because of the money, which we carried back the first time in our sacks, we are brought in: that he may bring upon us a false accusation, and by violence make slaves of us and our asses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.19"><v id="19"></v>Wherefore going up to the steward of the house, at the door, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.20"><v id="20"></v>They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us: We came down once before to buy food: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.21"><v id="21"></v>And when we had bought, and come to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks: which we have now brought again in the same weight. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.22"><v id="22"></v>And we have brought other money besides, to buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it in our bags. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.23"><v id="23"></v>But he answered: Peace be with you, fear not: your God, and the God of your Father hath given you treasure in your sacks. For the money, which you gave me, I have for good. And he brought Simeon out to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.24"><v id="24"></v>And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.25"><v id="25"></v>But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came at noon: for they had heard that they should eat bread there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.26"><v id="26"></v>Then Joseph came into his house, and they offered him the presents holding them in their hands, and they bowed down with their face to the ground. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.27"><v id="27"></v>But he, courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying: Is the old man your father in health, of whom uou told me? Is he yet living? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.28"><v id="28"></v>And they answered: Thy servant our father is in health, he is yet living. And bowing themselves they made obeisance to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.29"><v id="29"></v>And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin his brother, by the same mother, and said: Is this your young brother, of whom you told me? And he said: God be gracious to thee, my son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.30"><v id="30"></v>And he made haste becouse his heart was moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out: And going into his chamber he wept. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.31"><v id="31"></v>And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained himself, and said: Set bread on the table. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.32"><v id="32"></v>And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him, apart, (for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane:) </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.33"><v id="33"></v>They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his age. And they wondered very much: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.43.34"><v id="34"></v>Taking the messes which they received of him: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five parts. And they drank, and were merry with him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.44.2"><v id="2"></v>And in the mouth of the younger's sack put my silver cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat. And it was so done. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.44.14"><v id="14"></v>And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph, (for he was not yet gone out of the place, ) and they altogether fell down before him on the ground. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.44.15"><v id="15"></v>And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.44.16"><v id="16"></v>And Juda said to him: What shall we answer my lord? or what shall we say, or be able justly to allege? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.44.17"><v id="17"></v>Joseph answered: God forbid that should do so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away free to your father. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.44.18"><v id="18"></v>Then Juda coming hearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears,and be not angry with thy servant: for after Pharao thou art, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.44.19"><v id="19"></v>My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father or a brother? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.44.20"><v id="20"></v>And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead: and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him tenderly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.44.21"><v id="21"></v>And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.1"><v id="1"></v>Then Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying: My father and brethren, their sheep and their herds, and all that they possess, are come out of the land of Chanaan: and behold they stay in the land of Gessen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.2"><v id="2"></v>Five men also the last of his brethren, he presented before the king: </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.4"><v id="4"></v>We are come to sojourn in thy land, because there is no grass for the flocks of thy servants, the famine being very grievous in the land of Chanaan: and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be in the land of Gessen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.5"><v id="5"></v>The king therefore said to Joseph: Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.8"><v id="8"></v>And being asked by him: How many are the days of the years of thy life? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.9"><v id="9"></v>He answered: The days of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years, few, and evil, and they are not come up to the days of the pilgrimage of my fathers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.10"><v id="10"></v>And blessing the king, he went out. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.11"><v id="11"></v>But Joseph gave a possession to his father and his brethren in Egypt, in the best place of the land, in Ramesses, as Pharao had commanded. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.12"><v id="12"></v>And he nourished them, and all his father's house, allowing food to every one. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.13"><v id="13"></v>For in the whole world there was want of bread, and a famine had op- pressed the land: more especially of Egypt and Chanaan. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.14"><v id="14"></v>Out of which he gathered up all the money for the corn which they bought, and brought it into the king's treasure. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.15"><v id="15"></v>And when the buyers wanted money, all Egypt came to Joseph, saying: Give us bread: why should we die in thy presence, having now net money. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.16"><v id="16"></v>And he answered them: Bring your cattle, and for them I will give you food, if you have no money. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.17"><v id="17"></v>And when they had brought them, he gave them food in exchange for their horses, and sheep, and oxen, end asses and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.18"><v id="18"></v>And they came the second year, and said to him: We will not hide from our lord, how that our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone: neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.19"><v id="19"></v>Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will be thins, both we and our lands: buy us to be the king's servants, and give us seed, lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a wilderness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.20"><v id="20"></v>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, every man selling his possessions, because of the greatness of the famine. And he brought it into Pharao's hands: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.21"><v id="21"></v>And all its people from one end of the borders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.22"><v id="22"></v>Except the land of the priests, which had been given them by the king: to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not forced to sell their possessions. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.23"><v id="23"></v>Then Joseph said to the people : Be- hold as you see, both you and your lands belong to Pharao: take seed and sow the fields, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.24"><v id="24"></v>That you may have corn. The fifth part you shall give to the king: the other four you shall have for seed, and for food for your families and children. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.25"><v id="25"></v>And they answered: Our life is in thy hand: only let my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.26"><v id="26"></v>From that time unto this day, in the whole land of Egypt, the fifth part is paid to the king, and it is become as a law, except the land of the priests, which was free from this covenant. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.27"><v id="27"></v>So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the land of Gessen, and possessed it: and grew, and was multiplied exceedingly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.28"><v id="28"></v>And he lived in it seventeen years: and all the days of his life came to a hundred and forty-seven years. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.29"><v id="29"></v>And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh, he called his son Joseph, and said to him: If I have found favour in thy sight, put thy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt shew me this kindness and truth, not to bury me in Egypt: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.30"><v id="30"></v>But I will sleep with my fathers, end thou shalt take me away out of this land, and bury me in the burying place of my ancestors. And Joseph answered him: I will do what thou hast commanded. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.47.31"><v id="31"></v>And he said: Swear then to me. And as he was swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the bed's head. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.1"><v id="1"></v>After these things, it was told Joseph that his father was sick: and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.2"><v id="2"></v>And it was told the old man: Behold I thy son Joseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened he sat on his bed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.3"><v id="3"></v>And when Joseph was come in to him, he said : God Almighty appeared to me at Lute, which is in the land of Chanaan: and he blessed me, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.5"><v id="5"></v>So thy two sons who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.7"><v id="7"></v>For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Ohanaan in the very journey, and it was springtime: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.8"><v id="8"></v>Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.9"><v id="9"></v>He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me that I may bless them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.10"><v id="10"></v>For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.11"><v id="11"></v>And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee: moreover God hath shewed me thy seed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.12"><v id="12"></v>And when Joseph had taken them from his father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.13"><v id="13"></v>And he set Ephraim on his right bend, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right hand, and brought them near to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.14"><v id="14"></v>But he stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses who was the elder, changing his hands. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.15"><v id="15"></v>And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.16"><v id="16"></v>The angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless these boys: and let my name be called upon them, and the names of my fathers Abraham, and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.17"><v id="17"></v>And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased: and taking his father's hand he tried to lift it from Ephraims head, and to remove it to the head of Manasses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.18"><v id="18"></v>And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father: for this is the first- born, put thy right hand upon his head. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.19"><v id="19"></v>But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I know: and this also shall become peoples, and shall be multiplied: but this younger brother shall be greater than he: and his seed shall grow into nations. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.48.20"><v id="20"></v>And he blessed them at that time, saying: In thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be said: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to Manasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.2"><v id="2"></v>And he commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.3"><v id="3"></v>And while they were fulfilling his commands, there passed forty days: for this was the manner with bodies that were embalmed, and Egypt mounted for him seventy days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.4"><v id="4"></v>And the time of the mourning being expired, Joseph spoke to the family of Pharao: If I have found favour in your sight, speak in the ears of Pharao: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.5"><v id="5"></v>For my father made me swear to him, saying: Behold I die: thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre which I have digged for myself in the land of Chanaan. So I will go up and bury my father, and return. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.6"><v id="6"></v>And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.7"><v id="7"></v>So he went up, and there went with him all the ancients of Pharao's house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.8"><v id="8"></v>And the house of Joseph with his brethren, except their children, and their flocks and herds, which they left in the land of Gessen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.9"><v id="9"></v>He had also in his train chariots and horsemen: and it was it great company. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.10"><v id="10"></v>And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan: where celebrating the exequies with a great and vehement lamentation, they spent full seven days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.11"><v id="11"></v>And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw this, they said: This is a great mourning to the Egyptians. And there- fore the name of that place was called, The mourning of Egypt. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.12"><v id="12"></v>So the sons of Jacob did as he had commanded them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.13"><v id="13"></v>And carrying him into the land of Chanaan, they buried him in the double cave which Abraham had bought together with the held for a possession of a buryingplace, of Ephron the Hethite over against Mambre. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.14"><v id="14"></v>And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren, and all that were in his company, after he had buried his father. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.15"><v id="15"></v>Now he being dead, his brethren were afraid, and talked one with another : Lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered, and requite us all the evil that we did to him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.16"><v id="16"></v>And they sent a message to him, saying: Thy father commanded us before he died, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.17"><v id="17"></v>That we should say thus much to thee from him: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren, and the sin and malice they practiced against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this wickedness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.18"><v id="18"></v>And his brethren came to him: and worshipping prostrate on the ground they said: We are thy servants. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.19"><v id="19"></v>And he answered them: Fear not: can we resist the will of God? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.20"><v id="20"></v>You thought evil against me: but God turned it into good, that he might exalt me, as at present you see, and might save many people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.21"><v id="21"></v>Fear not: I will feed you and your children. And he comforted them, and spoke gently and mildly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.22"><v id="22"></v>And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father's house: and lived a hundred and ten years. And he saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Ma-nasses were born on Joseph's knees. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.23"><v id="23"></v>After which he told his brethren: God will visit you after my death, and will make you go up out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.24"><v id="24"></v>And he made them swear to him, saying: God will visit you, Carry my bones with you out of this place: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="1.50.25"><v id="25"></v>And he died being a hundred and ten years old. And being embalmed he was laid in a coffin in Egypt.</bcv></p0>
