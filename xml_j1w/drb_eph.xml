<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.5"><v id="5"></v>Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.6"><v id="6"></v>Not serving to the eye, as it were pleasing men, but, as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.7"><v id="7"></v>With a good will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.8"><v id="8"></v>Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond, or free. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.9"><v id="9"></v>And you, masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatenings, knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.10"><v id="10"></v>Finally, brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and in the might of his power. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.11"><v id="11"></v>Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.12"><v id="12"></v>For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and power, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.13"><v id="13"></v>Therefore take unto you the armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and to stand in all things perfect. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.14"><v id="14"></v>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of justice, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.15"><v id="15"></v>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.16"><v id="16"></v>In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.17"><v id="17"></v>And take unto you the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God). </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.18"><v id="18"></v>By all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the spirit; and in the same watching with all instance and supplication for all the saints: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.19"><v id="19"></v>And for me, that speech may be given me, that I may open my mouth with confidence, to make known the mystery of the gospel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.20"><v id="20"></v>For which I am an ambassador in a chain, so that therein I may be bold to speak according as I ought. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.21"><v id="21"></v>But that you also may know the things that concern me, and what I am doing, Tychicus, my dearest brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.22"><v id="22"></v>Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose, that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.23"><v id="23"></v>Peace be to the brethren and charity with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="49.6.24"><v id="24"></v>Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Amen.</bcv></p0>
