<p0><bcv bcv="62.1.1"><v id="1"></v>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.1.2"><v id="2"></v>For the life was manifested; and we have seen and do bear witness, and declare unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father, and hath appeared to us: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.1.3"><v id="3"></v>That which we have seen and have heard, we declare unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship may be with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.1.4"><v id="4"></v>And these things we write to you, that you may rejoice, and your joy may be full. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.1.5"><v id="5"></v>And this is the declaration which we have heard from him, and declare unto you: That God is light, and in him there is no darkness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.1.6"><v id="6"></v>If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.1.7"><v id="7"></v>But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.1.8"><v id="8"></v>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.1.9"><v id="9"></v>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all iniquity. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.1"><v id="1"></v>My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.2"><v id="2"></v>And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.4"><v id="4"></v>He who saith that he knoweth him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.5"><v id="5"></v>But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is perfected; and by this we know that we are in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.6"><v id="6"></v>He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also to walk, even as he walked. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.7"><v id="7"></v>Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.8"><v id="8"></v>Again a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true both in him and in you; because the darkness is passed, and the true light now shineth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.9"><v id="9"></v>He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.10"><v id="10"></v>He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is no scandal in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.11"><v id="11"></v>But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth; because the darkness hath blinded his eyes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.12"><v id="12"></v>I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.13"><v id="13"></v>I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him, who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.14"><v id="14"></v>I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.15"><v id="15"></v>Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.16"><v id="16"></v>For all that is in the world, is the concupiscence of the flesh, and the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not of the Father, but is of the world. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.17"><v id="17"></v>And the world passeth away, and the concupiscence thereof: but he that doth the will of God, abideth for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.18"><v id="18"></v>Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists: whereby we know that it is the last hour. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.19"><v id="19"></v>They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us; but that they may be manifest, that they are not all of us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.20"><v id="20"></v>But you have the unction from the Holy One, and know all things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.21"><v id="21"></v>I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.22"><v id="22"></v>Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who denieth the Father, and the Son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.23"><v id="23"></v>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.24"><v id="24"></v>As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning, abide in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.25"><v id="25"></v>And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life everlasting. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.26"><v id="26"></v>These things have I written to you, concerning them that seduce you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.27"><v id="27"></v>And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him, abide in you. And you have no need that any man teach you; but as his unction teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.28"><v id="28"></v>And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be confounded by him at his coming. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.2.29"><v id="29"></v>If you know, that he is just, know ye, that every one also, who doth justice, is born of him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.2"><v id="2"></v>Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God; and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know, that, when he shall appear, we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.3"><v id="3"></v>And every one that hath this hope in him, sanctifieth himself, as he also is holy. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.4"><v id="4"></v>Whosoever committeth sin commmitteth also iniquity; and sin is iniquity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.5"><v id="5"></v>And you know that he appeared to take away our sins, and in him there is no sin. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.6"><v id="6"></v>Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not; and whosoever sinneth, hath not seen him, nor known him. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.8"><v id="8"></v>He that commmitteth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose, the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the devil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.9"><v id="9"></v>Whosoever is born of God, commmitteth not sin: for his seed abideth in him, and he can not sin, because he is born of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.10"><v id="10"></v>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not just, is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.12"><v id="12"></v>Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and killed his brother. And wherefore did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and his brother's just. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.13"><v id="13"></v>Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.14"><v id="14"></v>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not, abideth in death. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.15"><v id="15"></v>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.16"><v id="16"></v>In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.17"><v id="17"></v>He that hath the substance of this world, and shall see his brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.18"><v id="18"></v>My little children, let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed, and in truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.19"><v id="19"></v>In this we know that we are of the truth: and in his sight shall persuade our hearts. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.20"><v id="20"></v>For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.21"><v id="21"></v>Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence towards God: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.22"><v id="22"></v>And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we keep his commandments, and do those things which are pleasing in his sight. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.3.23"><v id="23"></v>And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ: and love one another, as he hath given commandment unto us. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.2"><v id="2"></v>By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.3"><v id="3"></v>And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus, is not of God: and this is Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh, and he is now already in the world. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.4"><v id="4"></v>You are of God, little children, and have overcome him. Because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.5"><v id="5"></v>They are of the world: therefore of the world they speak, and the world heareth them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.6"><v id="6"></v>We are of God. He that knoweth God, heareth us. He that is not of God, heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.7"><v id="7"></v>Dearly beloved, let us love one another, for charity is of God. And every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.8"><v id="8"></v>He that loveth not, knoweth not God: for God is charity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.9"><v id="9"></v>By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.10"><v id="10"></v>In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.11"><v id="11"></v>My dearest, if God hath so loved us; we also ought to love one another. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.12"><v id="12"></v>No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us, and his charity is perfected in us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.13"><v id="13"></v>In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us: because he hath given us of his spirit. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.14"><v id="14"></v>And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.16"><v id="16"></v>And we have known, and have believed the charity, which God hath to us. God is charity: and he that abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.17"><v id="17"></v>In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment: because as he is, we also are in this world. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="62.4.18"><v id="18"></v>Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth out fear, because fear hath pain. And he that feareth, is not perfected in charity. </bcv></p0>
