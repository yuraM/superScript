<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.1"><v id="1"></v>Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained equal faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.2"><v id="2"></v>Grace to you and peace be accomplished in the knowledge of God and of Christ Jesus our Lord: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.3"><v id="3"></v>As all things of his divine power which appertain to life and godliness, are given us, through the knowledge of him who hath called us by his own proper glory and virtue. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.4"><v id="4"></v>By whom he hath given us most great and precious promises: that by these you may be made partakers of the divine nature: flying the corruption of that concupiscence which is in the world. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.5"><v id="5"></v>And you, employing all care, minister in your faith, virtue; and in virtue, knowledge; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.6"><v id="6"></v>And in knowledge, abstinence; and in abstinence, patience; and in patience, godliness; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.7"><v id="7"></v>And in godliness, love of brotherhood; and in love of brotherhood, charity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.8"><v id="8"></v>For if these things be with you and abound, they will make you to be neither empty nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.9"><v id="9"></v>For he that hath not these things with him, is blind, and groping, having forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.10"><v id="10"></v>Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by good works you may make sure your calling and election. For doing these things, you shall not sin at any time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.11"><v id="11"></v>For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.12"><v id="12"></v>For which cause I will begin to put you always in remembrance of these things: though indeed you know them, and are confirmed in the present truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.13"><v id="13"></v>But I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.14"><v id="14"></v>Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at hand, according as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified to me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.15"><v id="15"></v>And I will endeavour, that you frequently have after my decease, whereby you may keep a memory of these things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.16"><v id="16"></v>For we have not by following artificial fables, made known to you the power, and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ; but we were eyewitnesses of his greatness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.17"><v id="17"></v>For he received from God the Father, honour and glory: this voice coming down to him from the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.18"><v id="18"></v>And this voice we heard brought from heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.19"><v id="19"></v>And we have the more firm prophetical word: whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.20"><v id="20"></v>Understanding this first, that no prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.1.21"><v id="21"></v>For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time: but the holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.1"><v id="1"></v>But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there shall be among you lying teachers, who shall bring in sects of perdition, and deny the Lord who bought them: bringing upon themselves swift destruction. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.2"><v id="2"></v>And many shall follow their riotousnesses, through whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you. Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their perdition slumbereth not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.4"><v id="4"></v>For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them, drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto torments, to be reserved unto judgment: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.5"><v id="5"></v>And spared not the original world, but preserved Noe, the eighth person, the preacher of justice, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.6"><v id="6"></v>And reducing the cities of the Sodomites, and of the Gomorrhites, into ashes, condemned them to be overthrown, making them an example to those that should after act wickedly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.7"><v id="7"></v>And delivered just Lot, oppressed by the injustice and lewd conversation of the wicked. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.8"><v id="8"></v>For in sight and hearing he was just: dwelling among them, who from day to day vexed the just soul with unjust works. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.9"><v id="9"></v>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from temptation, but to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be tormented. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.10"><v id="10"></v>And especially them who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government, audacious, self willed, they fear not to bring in sects, blaspheming. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.11"><v id="11"></v>Whereas angels who are greater in strength and power, bring not against themselves a railing judgment. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.12"><v id="12"></v>But these men, as irrational beasts, naturally tending to the snare and to destruction, blaspheming those things which they know not, shall perish in their corruption, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.13"><v id="13"></v>Receiving the reward of their injustice, counting for a pleasure the delights of a day: stains and spots, sporting themselves to excess, rioting in their feasts with you: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.14"><v id="14"></v>Having eyes full of adultery and of sin that ceaseth not: alluring unstable souls, having their heart exercised with covetousness, children of malediction: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.15"><v id="15"></v>Leaving the right way they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam of Bosor, who loved the wages of iniquity, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.16"><v id="16"></v>But had a check of his madness, the dumb beast used to the yoke, which speaking with man's voice, forbade the folly of the prophet. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.17"><v id="17"></v>These are fountains without water, and clouds tossed with whirlwinds, to whom the mist of darkness is reserved. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.18"><v id="18"></v>For, speaking proud words of vanity, they allure by the desires of fleshly riotousness, those who for a little while escape, such as converse in error: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.19"><v id="19"></v>Promising them liberty, whereas they themselves are the slaves of corruption. For by whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the slave. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.20"><v id="20"></v>For if, flying from the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they be again entangled in them and overcome: their latter state is become unto them worse than the former. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.21"><v id="21"></v>For it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice, than after they have known it, to turn back from that holy commandment which was delivered to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.2.22"><v id="22"></v>For, that of the true proverb has happened to them: The dog is returned to his vomit: and, The sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.1"><v id="1"></v>Behold this second epistle I write to you, my dearly beloved, in which I stir up by way of admonition your sincere mind: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.2"><v id="2"></v>That you may be mindful of those words which I told you before from the holy prophets, and of your apostles, of the precepts of the Lord and Saviour. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.3"><v id="3"></v>Knowing this first, that in the last days there shall come deceitful scoffers, walking after their own lusts, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.4"><v id="4"></v>Saying: Where is his promise or his coming? for since the time that the fathers slept, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.5"><v id="5"></v>For this they are wilfully ignorant of, that the heavens were before, and the earth out of water, and through water, consisting by the word of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.6"><v id="6"></v>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.7"><v id="7"></v>But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of the ungodly men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.8"><v id="8"></v>But of this one thing be not ignorant, my beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.9"><v id="9"></v>The Lord delayeth not his promise, as some imagine, but dealeth patiently for your sake, not willing that any should perish, but that all should return to penance. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.10"><v id="10"></v>But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief, in which the heavens shall pass away with great violence, and the elements shall be melted with heat, and the earth and the works which are in it, shall be burnt up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.11"><v id="11"></v>Seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved, what manner of people ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.12"><v id="12"></v>Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of the Lord, by which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with the burning heat? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.13"><v id="13"></v>But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to his promises, in which justice dwelleth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.14"><v id="14"></v>Wherefore, dearly beloved, waiting for these things, be diligent that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.15"><v id="15"></v>And account the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation; as also our most dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, hath written to you: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.16"><v id="16"></v>As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.17"><v id="17"></v>You therefore, brethren, knowing these things before, take heed, lest being led aside by the error of the unwise, you fall from your own steadfastness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="61.3.18"><v id="18"></v>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and unto the day of eternity. Amen.</bcv></p0>
