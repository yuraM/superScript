<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.1"><v id="1"></v>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.2"><v id="2"></v>And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.3"><v id="3"></v>Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.4"><v id="4"></v>I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.5"><v id="5"></v>Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.6"><v id="6"></v>That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work, that is in you in Christ Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.7"><v id="7"></v>For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.8"><v id="8"></v>Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus, to command thee that which is to the purpose: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.9"><v id="9"></v>For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul an old man, and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.10"><v id="10"></v>I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.11"><v id="11"></v>Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to me and thee, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.12"><v id="12"></v>Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.13"><v id="13"></v>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.14"><v id="14"></v>But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.15"><v id="15"></v>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee, that thou mightest receive him again for ever: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.16"><v id="16"></v>Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.17"><v id="17"></v>If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.18"><v id="18"></v>And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy debt, put that to my account. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.19"><v id="19"></v>I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self also. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.20"><v id="20"></v>Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord. Refresh my bowels in the Lord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.21"><v id="21"></v>Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.22"><v id="22"></v>But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.23"><v id="23"></v>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.24"><v id="24"></v>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow labourers. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="57.1.25"><v id="25"></v>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</bcv></p0>
