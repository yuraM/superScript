<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.2"><v id="2"></v>I am the most foolish of men, and the wisdom of men is not with me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.3"><v id="3"></v>I have not learned wisdom, and have not known the science of saints. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.4"><v id="4"></v>Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended? who hath held the wind in his hands? who hath bound up the waters together as in a garment? who hath raised up all the borders of the earth? what is his name, and what is the name of his son, if thou knowest? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.5"><v id="5"></v>Every word of God is fire tried: he is a buckler to them that hope in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.6"><v id="6"></v>Add not any thing to his words, lest thou be reproved, and found a liar: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.7"><v id="7"></v>Two things I have asked of thee, deny them not to me before I die. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.8"><v id="8"></v>Remove far from me vanity, and lying words. Give me neither beggary, nor riches: give me only the necessaries of life: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.9"><v id="9"></v>Lest perhaps being filled, I should be tempted to deny, and say: Who is the Lord? or being compelled by poverty, I should steal, and forswear the name of my God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.10"><v id="10"></v>Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou fall. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.29"><v id="29"></v>There are three things, which go well, and the fourth that walketh happily: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.30"><v id="30"></v>A lion, the strongest of beasts, who hath no fear of any thing he meeteth: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.31"><v id="31"></v>A cock girded about the loins: and a ram: and a king, whom none can resist. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.32"><v id="32"></v>There is that hath appeared a fool after he was lifted up on high: for if he had understood, he would have laid his hand upon his mouth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="20.30.33"><v id="33"></v>And he that strongly squeezeth the papa to bring out milk, straineth out butter: and he that violently bloweth his nose, bringeth out blood: and he that provoketh wrath bringeth forth strife. </bcv></p0>
