<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.1"><v id="1"></v>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother: to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.2"><v id="2"></v>Grace unto you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.3"><v id="3"></v>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.4"><v id="4"></v>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation; that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.5"><v id="5"></v>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ doth our comfort abound. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.6"><v id="6"></v>Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.7"><v id="7"></v>That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.8"><v id="8"></v>For we would not have you ignorant,brethren, of our tribulation, which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above our strength, so that we were weary even of life. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.9"><v id="9"></v>But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.10"><v id="10"></v>Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.11"><v id="11"></v>You helping withal in prayer for us: that for this gift obtained for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.12"><v id="12"></v>For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.13"><v id="13"></v>For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known. And I hope that you shall know unto the end: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.14"><v id="14"></v>As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.15"><v id="15"></v>And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.16"><v id="16"></v>And to pass by you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.17"><v id="17"></v>Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.18"><v id="18"></v>But God is faithful, for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.19"><v id="19"></v>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, by me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It is not, but, It is, was in him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.20"><v id="20"></v>For all the promises of God are in him, It is; therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.21"><v id="21"></v>Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us, is God: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.22"><v id="22"></v>Who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.1.23"><v id="23"></v>But I call God to witness upon my soul, that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth: not because we exercise dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy: for in faith you stand. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.1"><v id="1"></v>But I determined this with myself, not to come to you again in sorrow. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.2"><v id="2"></v>For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And I wrote this same to you; that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow, from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.4"><v id="4"></v>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.5"><v id="5"></v>And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me; but in part, that I may not burden you all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.6"><v id="6"></v>To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.7"><v id="7"></v>So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.8"><v id="8"></v>Wherefore, I beseech you, that you would confirm your charity towards him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.9"><v id="9"></v>For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all things. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.10"><v id="10"></v>And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.11"><v id="11"></v>That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.12"><v id="12"></v>And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened unto me in the Lord, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.13"><v id="13"></v>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.14"><v id="14"></v>Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.15"><v id="15"></v>For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.16"><v id="16"></v>To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.2.17"><v id="17"></v>For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.1"><v id="1"></v>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.2"><v id="2"></v>You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.3"><v id="3"></v>Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.4"><v id="4"></v>And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.5"><v id="5"></v>Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.6"><v id="6"></v>Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter, but in the spirit. For the letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.7"><v id="7"></v>Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which is made void: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.8"><v id="8"></v>How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.9"><v id="9"></v>For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.10"><v id="10"></v>For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified, by reason of the glory that excelleth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.11"><v id="11"></v>For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is in glory. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.12"><v id="12"></v>Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.13"><v id="13"></v>And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.14"><v id="14"></v>But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made void). </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.15"><v id="15"></v>But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.16"><v id="16"></v>But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.17"><v id="17"></v>Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.3.18"><v id="18"></v>But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.1"><v id="1"></v>Therefore, seeing we have this ministration, according as we have obtained mercy, we faint not; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.2"><v id="2"></v>But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience, in the sight of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.3"><v id="3"></v>And if our gospel be also hid, it is hid to them that are lost, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.4"><v id="4"></v>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of unbelievers, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine unto them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.5"><v id="5"></v>For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord; and ourselves your servants through Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.6"><v id="6"></v>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Christ Jesus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.7"><v id="7"></v>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency may be of the power of God, and not of us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.8"><v id="8"></v>In all things we suffer tribulation, but are not distressed; we are straitened, but are not destitute; </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.9"><v id="9"></v>We suffer persecution, but are not forsaken; we are cast down, but we perish not: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.10"><v id="10"></v>Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.11"><v id="11"></v>For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake; that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.12"><v id="12"></v>So then death worketh in us, but life in you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.13"><v id="13"></v>But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I believed, for which cause I have spoken; we also believe, for which cause we speak also: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.14"><v id="14"></v>Knowing that he who raised up Jesus, will raise us up also with Jesus, and place us with you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.15"><v id="15"></v>For all things are for your sakes; that the grace abounding through many, may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.16"><v id="16"></v>For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.17"><v id="17"></v>For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation, worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.4.18"><v id="18"></v>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen, are temporal; but the things which are not seen, are eternal. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.1"><v id="1"></v>For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.2"><v id="2"></v>For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our habitation that is from heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.3"><v id="3"></v>Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.4"><v id="4"></v>For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.5"><v id="5"></v>Now he that maketh us for this very thing, is God, who hath given us the pledge of the Spirit. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.9"><v id="9"></v>And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.10"><v id="10"></v>For we must all be manifested before the judgement seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.11"><v id="11"></v>Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men; but to God we are manifest. And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.12"><v id="12"></v>We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory in our behalf; that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face, and not in heart. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.13"><v id="13"></v>For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.14"><v id="14"></v>For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.15"><v id="15"></v>And Christ died for all; that they also who live, may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.16"><v id="16"></v>Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh; but now we know him so no longer. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.17"><v id="17"></v>If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away, behold all things are made new. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.18"><v id="18"></v>But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ; and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.19"><v id="19"></v>For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins; and he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.5.20"><v id="20"></v>For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by us. For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.1"><v id="1"></v>Now we make known unto you, brethren, the grace of God, that hath been given in the churches of Macedonia. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.2"><v id="2"></v>That in much experience of tribulation, they have had abundance of joy; and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their simplicity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.3"><v id="3"></v>For according to their power ( I bear them witness), and beyond their power, they were willing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.4"><v id="4"></v>With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the ministry that is done toward the saints. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.5"><v id="5"></v>And not as we hoped, but they gave their own selves first to the Lord, then to us by the will of God: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.6"><v id="6"></v>Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so also he would finish among you this same grace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.7"><v id="7"></v>That as in all things you abound in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all carefulness; moreover also in your charity towards us, so in this grace also you may abound. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.8"><v id="8"></v>I speak not as commanding; but by the carefulness of others, approving also the good disposition of your charity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.9"><v id="9"></v>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich he became poor, for your sakes; that through his poverty you might be rich. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.10"><v id="10"></v>And herein I give my advice; for this is profitable for you, who have begun not only to do, but also to be willing, a year ago. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.11"><v id="11"></v>Now therefore perform ye it also in deed; that as your mind is forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which you have. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.12"><v id="12"></v>For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to that which a man hath, not according to that which he hath not. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.13"><v id="13"></v>For I mean not that others should be eased, and you burthened, but by an equality. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.14"><v id="14"></v>In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may supply your want, that there may be an equality, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.15"><v id="15"></v>As it is written: He that had much, had nothing over; and he that had little, had no want. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.16"><v id="16"></v>And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness for you in the heart of Titus. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.17"><v id="17"></v>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more careful, of his own will he went unto you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.18"><v id="18"></v>We have sent also with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel through all the churches. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.19"><v id="19"></v>And not that only, but he was also ordained by the churches companion of our travels, for this grace, which is administered by us, to the glory of the Lord, and our determined will: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.20"><v id="20"></v>Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.21"><v id="21"></v>For we forecast what may be good not only before God, but also before men. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.22"><v id="22"></v>And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often proved diligent in many things; but now much more diligent, with much confidence in you, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.23"><v id="23"></v>Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer towards you, or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.8.24"><v id="24"></v>Wherefore shew ye to them, in the sight of the churches, the evidence of your charity, and of our boasting on your behalf. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.2"><v id="2"></v>For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the Macedonians. That Achaia also is ready from the year past, and your emulation hath provoked very many. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.3"><v id="3"></v>Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you, be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.4"><v id="4"></v>Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.5"><v id="5"></v>Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before, and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.6"><v id="6"></v>Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings, shall also reap blessings. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.7"><v id="7"></v>Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.8"><v id="8"></v>And God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.9"><v id="9"></v>As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.10"><v id="10"></v>And he that ministereth seed to the sower, will both give you bread to eat, and will multiply your seed, and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.11"><v id="11"></v>That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.12"><v id="12"></v>Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.13"><v id="13"></v>By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them, and unto all. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.9.14"><v id="14"></v>And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.10.2"><v id="2"></v>But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present, with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some, who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.10.3"><v id="3"></v>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.10.8"><v id="8"></v>For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.10.9"><v id="9"></v>But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.10.10"><v id="10"></v>(For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible,) </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.10.11"><v id="11"></v>Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles, when absent, such also we will be indeed when present. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.10.12"><v id="12"></v>For we dare not match, or compare ourselves with some, that commend themselves; but we measure ourselves by ourselves, and compare ourselves with ourselves. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.10.13"><v id="13"></v>But we will not glory beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the rule, which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.10.14"><v id="14"></v>For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the gospel of Christ. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.10.15"><v id="15"></v>Not glorying beyond measure in other men's labours; but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly; </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.11.8"><v id="8"></v>I have taken from other churches, receiving wages of them for your ministry. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.11.9"><v id="9"></v>And, when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was wanting to me, the brethren supplied who came from Macedonia; and in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to you, and so I will keep myself. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.11.10"><v id="10"></v>The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not be broken off in me in the regions of Achaia. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.11.15"><v id="15"></v>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as the ministers of justice, whose end shall be according to their works. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.11.16"><v id="16"></v>I say again, (let no man think me to be foolish, otherwise take me as one foolish, that I also may glory a little.) </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.11.17"><v id="17"></v>That which I speak, I speak not according to God, but as it were in foolishness, in this matter of glorying. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.11.18"><v id="18"></v>Seeing that many glory according to the flesh, I will glory also. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.11.21"><v id="21"></v>I speak according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in this part. Wherein if any man dare (I speak foolishly), I dare also. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="47.13.7"><v id="7"></v>Now we pray God, that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good, and that we may be as reprobates. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.13.8"><v id="8"></v>For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.13.9"><v id="9"></v>For we rejoice that we are weak, and you are strong. This also we pray for, your perfection. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.13.10"><v id="10"></v>Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification, and not unto destruction. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.13.11"><v id="11"></v>For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace; and the God of peace and of love shall be with you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.13.12"><v id="12"></v>Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints salute you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="47.13.13"><v id="13"></v>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.</bcv></p0>
