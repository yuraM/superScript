<p0><bcv bcv="15.1.2"><v id="2"></v>Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians: The Lord the God of heaven hath given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.1.3"><v id="3"></v>Who is there among you of all his people? His God be with him. Let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Jndert, and build the house of the Lord the God of Israel: he is the God that is in Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.1.4"><v id="4"></v>And let all the restin all places wheresoever they dwell, help him every man from his place. with silver and gold, and goods, and cattle, besides that which they offer freely to the temple of God, which is in Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.1.5"><v id="5"></v>Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Juda and Benjamin, and the priests, and Levites, and every one whose spirit God had raised up, to go up to build the temple of the Lord, which was in Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.1.6"><v id="6"></v>And all they that were round about, helped their hands with vessels of silver, and gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with furniture, besides what they had offered on their own accord. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.1.7"><v id="7"></v>And king Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the temple of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had taken from Jerusalem, and had put them in the temple of his god. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.1.8"><v id="8"></v>Now Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithridates the son of Gazabar, and numbered them to Sassabasar the prince of Juda. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.1.9"><v id="9"></v>And this is the number of them: thirty bowls of gold, a thousand bowls of silver, nine and twenty knives, thirty cups of gold, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="15.3.3"><v id="3"></v>And they set the altar of God upon its bases, while the people of the lands round about put them in fear, and they offered upon it a holocaust to the Lord morning and evening. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="15.4.14"><v id="14"></v>But we remembering the salt that we have eaten in the palace, and because we count it a crime to see the king wronged, have therefore sent and certified the king, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="15.4.16"><v id="16"></v>We certify the king, that if this city be built, and the walls thereof repaired, thou shalt have no possession on this side of the river. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.4.17"><v id="17"></v>The king sent word to Reum Beelteem and Samsai the scribe, and to the rest that were in their council, inhabitants of Samaria, and to the rest beyond the river, sending greeting and peace. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.4.18"><v id="18"></v>The accusation, which you have sent to us, hath been plainly read before me, </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="15.5.8"><v id="8"></v>Be it known to the king, that we went to the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which they are building with unpolished stones, and timber is laid in the walls: and this work is carried on diligently, and advanceth in their hands. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.5.9"><v id="9"></v>And we asked those ancients, and said to them thus: Who hath given you authority to build this house, and to repair these walls? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.5.10"><v id="10"></v>We asked also of them their names, that we might give thee notice: and we have written the names of the men that are the chief among them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.5.11"><v id="11"></v>And they answered us in these words, saying: We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building a temple that was built these many years ago, and which a great king of Israel built and set up. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.5.12"><v id="12"></v>But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he delivered them into the hands of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon the Chaldean: and he destroyed this house, and carried away the people to Babylon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.5.13"><v id="13"></v>But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, king Cyrus set forth al decree, that this house of God should be built. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.5.14"><v id="14"></v>And the vessels also of gold and silver of the temple of God, which Nabuchodonosor had taken out of the temple, that was in Jerusalem, and had brought them to the temple of Babylon, king Cyrus brought out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one Sassabasar, whom also he appointed governor, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.5.15"><v id="15"></v>And said to him: Take these vessels, and go, and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.5.16"><v id="16"></v>Then came this same Sassabasar, and laid the foundations of the temple of God in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it is in building, and is not yet finished. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.5.17"><v id="17"></v>Now therefore if it seem good to the king, let him search in the king's library, which is in Babylon, whether it hath been decreed by Cyrus the king, that the house of God in Jerusalem should be built, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="15.6.8"><v id="8"></v>I also have commanded what must be done by those ancients of the Jews, that the house of God may be built, to wit, that of the king's chest, that is, of the tribute that is paid out of the country beyond the river, the charges be diligently given to those men, lest the work be hindered. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.6.9"><v id="9"></v>And if it shall be necessary, let calves also, and lambs, and kids, for holocausts to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the custom of the priests that are in Jerusalem, be given them day by day, that there be no complaint in any thing. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="15.9.11"><v id="11"></v>Which thou hast commanded by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying: The land which you go to possess, is an unclean land, according to the uncleanness of the people, and of other lands, with their abominations, who have filled it from mouth to mouth with their filth. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.1"><v id="1"></v>Now when Esdras was thus praying, and beseeching, and weeping, and lying before the temple of God, there was gathered to him of Israel an exceeding great assembly of men and women and children, and the people wept with much lamentation. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.2"><v id="2"></v>And Sechenias the son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam answered, and said to Esdras: We have sinned against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: and now if there be repentance in Israel concerning this, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.3"><v id="3"></v>Let us make a covenant with the Lord our God, to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the will of the Lord, and of them that fear the commandment of the Lord our God: let it be done according to the law. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.4"><v id="4"></v>Arise, it is thy part to give orders, and we will be with thee: take courage, and do it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.5"><v id="5"></v>So Esdras arose, and made the chiefs of the priests and of the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word, and they swore. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.6"><v id="6"></v>And Esdras rose up from before the house of God, and went to the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliasib, and entered in thither: he ate no bread, and drank no water: for he mourned for the transgression of them that were come out of the captivity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.7"><v id="7"></v>And proclamation was made in Juda and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble together into Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.8"><v id="8"></v>And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the ancients, all his substance should be taken away, and he should be cast out of the company of them that were returned from captivity. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.9"><v id="9"></v>Then all the men of Juda, and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within three days, in the ninth month, the twentieth day of the month: and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of the sin, and the rain. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.10"><v id="10"></v>And Esdras the priest stood up, and said to them: You have transgressed, and taken strange wives, to add to the sine of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.11"><v id="11"></v>And now make confession to the Lord the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure, and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from your strange wives. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.12"><v id="12"></v>And all the multitude answered and said with a loud voice: According to thy word unto us, so be it done. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.13"><v id="13"></v>But as the people are many, and it is time of rain, and me are not able to stand without, and it is not a work of one day or two, (for we have exceedingly sinned in this matter,) </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.14"><v id="14"></v>Let rulers be appointed in all the multitude: and in all our cities, let them that have taken strange wives come at the times appointed, and with them the ancients and the judges of every city, until the wrath of our God be turned away from us for this sin. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.15"><v id="15"></v>Then Jonathan the son of Azahel, and Jaasia the son of Thecua were appointed over this, and Mesollam and Sebethai, Levites, helped them: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.16"><v id="16"></v>And the children of the captivity did so. And Esdras the priest, and the men heads of the families in the houses of their fathers, and all by their names, went and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="15.10.17"><v id="17"></v>And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month. </bcv></p0>
