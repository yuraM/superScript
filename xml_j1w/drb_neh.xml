<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.1"><v id="1"></v>The words of Nehemias the son of Helchias. And it came to pass in the month of Casleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in the castle of Susa, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.2"><v id="2"></v>That Hanani one of my brethren came, he and some men of Juda; and I asked them concerning the Jews, that remained and were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.3"><v id="3"></v>And they said to me: They that have remained, and are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction, and reproach: and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.4"><v id="4"></v>And when I had heard these words, I sat down, and wept, and mourned for many days: and I fasted, and prayed before the face of the God of heaven. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.5"><v id="5"></v>And I said: WI beseech thee, 0 Lord God of heaven, strong, great, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy with those that love thee, and keep thy commandments : </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.6"><v id="6"></v>Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day, for the children of Israel thy servants: and I confess the sins of the children of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee: I and my father's house have sinned. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.7"><v id="7"></v>We have been seduced by vanity, and have not kept thy commandments, and ceremonies and judgments, which thou hast commanded thy servant Moses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.8"><v id="8"></v>Remember the word that thou commandedst to Moses thy servant, saying: If you shall transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.9"><v id="9"></v>But if you return to me, and keep my commandments, and do them, though you should be led away to the uttermost parts of the world, I will gather you from thence, and bring you back to the place which I have chosen for my name to dwell there. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.10"><v id="10"></v>And these are thy servants, and thy people : whom thou hast redeemed by thy great strength, and by thy mighty hand. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.1.11"><v id="11"></v>I beseech thee, O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name: and direct thy servant this day, and give him mercy before this man. For I was the king's cupbearer. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.1"><v id="1"></v>And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king: that wine was before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king: and I was as one languishing away before his face. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.2"><v id="2"></v>And the king said to me: Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou dost not appear to be sick? this is not without cause, but some evil, I know not what, is in thy heart. And I was seized with an exceeding great fear: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.3"><v id="3"></v>And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.4"><v id="4"></v>Then the king said to me: For what dost thou make request? And I prayed to the God of heaven, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.5"><v id="5"></v>And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, and if thy servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me into Judea to the city of the sepulchre of my father, and I will build it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.6"><v id="6"></v>And the king said to me, and the queen that sat by him: For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king, and he sent me: and I fixed him a time. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.7"><v id="7"></v>And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors of the country beyond the river, that they convey me over, till I come into Judea: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.8"><v id="8"></v>And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, to give me timber that I may cover the gates of the tower of the house, and the walls of the city, and the house that I shall enter into. And the king gave me according to the good hand of my God with me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.9"><v id="9"></v>And I came to the governors of the country beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. And the king had sent wish me captains of soldiers, and horsemen. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.10"><v id="10"></v>And Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite, heard it, and it grieved them exceedingly, that a man was come, who sought the prosperity of the children of Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.11"><v id="11"></v>And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.12"><v id="12"></v>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me, and I told not any man what God had put in my heart to do in Jerusalem, and there was no beast with me, but the beast that I rode upon. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.13"><v id="13"></v>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, and before the dragon fountain, and to the dung gate, and I viewed the wall of Jerusalem which was broken down, and the gates thereof which were consumed with fire. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.14"><v id="14"></v>And I passed to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's aqueduct, and there was no place for the beast on which I rode to pass. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.15"><v id="15"></v>And I went up in the night by the torrent, and viewed the wall, and going back I came to the gate of the valley, and returned. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.16"><v id="16"></v>But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I did: neither had I as yet told any thing to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest that did the work. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.17"><v id="17"></v>Then I said to them: You know the affliction wherein we are, because Jerusalem is desolate, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire: come, and let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, and let us be no longer a reproach. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.18"><v id="18"></v>And I shewed them how the hand of my God was good with me, and the king's words, which he had spoken to me, and I said: Let us rise up, and build. And their hands were strengthened in good. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.19"><v id="19"></v>But Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite, and Gossem the Arabian heard of it, and they scoffed at us, and despised us, and said: What is this thing that you do? are you going to rebel against the king? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.2.20"><v id="20"></v>And I answered them, and said to them: The God of heaven he helpeth us, and we are his servants: let us rise up and build: but you have no part, nor justice, nor remembrance in Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.1"><v id="1"></v>And it came to pass, that when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall he was angry: and being moved exceedingly he scoffed at the Jews. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.2"><v id="2"></v>And said before his brethren, and the multitude of the Samaritans: What are the silly Jews doing? Will the Gentiles let them alone? will they sacrifice and make an end in a day? are they able to raise stones out of the heaps of the rubbish, which are burnt? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.3"><v id="3"></v>Tobias also the Ammonite who was by him said : Let them build: if a fox go up, he will leap over their stone wall. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.4"><v id="4"></v>Hear thou our God, for we are despised: turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them to be despised in a land of captivity. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.6"><v id="6"></v>So we built the wall, and joined it all together unto the half thereof: and the heart of the people was excited to work. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.7"><v id="7"></v>And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Azotians heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and the breaches began to be closed, that they were exceedingly angry. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.8"><v id="8"></v>And they all assembled themselves together, to come, and to fight against Jerusalem, and to prepare ambushes. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.9"><v id="9"></v>And we prayed to our God, and set watchmen upon the wall day and night against them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.10"><v id="10"></v>And Juda said: The strength of the bearer of burdens is decayed, and the rubbish is very much, and we shall not be able to build the wall. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.11"><v id="11"></v>And our enemies said: Let them not know, nor understand, till we come in the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.12"><v id="12"></v>And it came to pass, that when the Jews that dwelt by them came and told us ten times, out of all the places from whence they came to us, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.13"><v id="13"></v>I set the people in the place behind the wall round about in order, with their swords, and spears, and bows. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.14"><v id="14"></v>And I looked and rose up: and I said to the chief men and the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: be not afraid of them. Remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your houses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.15"><v id="15"></v>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that the thing had been told us, that God defeated their counsel. And we returned all of us to the walls, every man to his work. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.16"><v id="16"></v>And it came to pass from that day forward, that half of their young men did the work, and half were ready for to fight, with spears, and shields, and bows, and coats of mail, and the rulers were behind them in all the house of Juda. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.17"><v id="17"></v>Of them that built on the wall and that carried burdens, and that laded: with one of his hands he did the work, and with the other he held a sword. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.18"><v id="18"></v>For every one of the builders was girded with a sword about his reins. And they built, and sounded with a trumpet by me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.19"><v id="19"></v>And I said to the nobles, and to the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: The work is great and wide, and we are separated on the wall one far from another: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.20"><v id="20"></v>In what place soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, run all thither unto us: our God will fight for us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.21"><v id="21"></v>And let us do the work: and let one half of us hold our spears from the rising of the morning, till the stars appear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.22"><v id="22"></v>At that time also I said to the people: Let every one with his servant stay in the midst of Jerusalem, and let us take our turns in the night, and by day, to work. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.4.23"><v id="23"></v>Now I and my brethren, and my servants, and the watchmen that followed me, did not put off our clothes: only every man stripped himself when he was to be washed. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.1"><v id="1"></v>Now there was a great cry of the people, and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.2"><v id="2"></v>And there were some that said: Our sons and our daughters are very many: Yet us take up corn for the price of them, and let us eat and live. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.3"><v id="3"></v>And there were some that said: Let us mortgage our lands, and our vineyards, and our houses, and let us take corn be- cause of the famine. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.4"><v id="4"></v>And others said: Let us borrow money for the king's tribute, and let us give up our fields and vineyards: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.5"><v id="5"></v>And now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren: and our children as their children. Behold we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters, and some of our daughters are bondwomen already, neither have we wherewith to redeem them, and our fields and our vineyards other men possess. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.6"><v id="6"></v>And I was exceedingly angry when I heard their cry according to these words. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.7"><v id="7"></v>And my heart thought with myself: and I rebuked the nobles and magistrates, and said to them: Do you every one ex- act usury of your brethren ? And I gathered together a great assembly against them, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.8"><v id="8"></v>And I said to them: We, as you know, have redeemed according to our ability our brethren the Jews, that were sold to the Gentiles: and will you then sell your brethren, for us to redeem them ? And they held their peace, and found not what to answer. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.9"><v id="9"></v>And I said to them: The thing you do is not good: why walk you not in the fear of our God, that we be not exposed to the reproaches of the Gentiles our enemies? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.10"><v id="10"></v>Both I and my brethren, and my servants, have lent money and corn to many: let us all agree not to call for it again; let us forgive the debt that is owing to us. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.11"><v id="11"></v>Restore ye to them this day their fields, and their vineyards, and their oliveyards, and their houses: and the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which you mere wont to exact of them, give it rather for them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.12"><v id="12"></v>And they said: We will restore, and we will require nothing of them: and we will do as thou sayest. And I called the priests and took an oath of them, to do according to what I had said. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.13"><v id="13"></v>Moreover I shook my lap, and said: So may God shake every man that shall not accomplish this word, out of his house, and out of his labours, thus may he be shaken out, and become empty. And all the multitude said: Amen. And they praised God. And the people did according to what was said. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.14"><v id="14"></v>And from the day, in which the king commanded me to be governor in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my brethren did not eat the yearly allowance that was due to the governors. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.15"><v id="15"></v>But the former governors that had been before me, were chargeable to the people, and took of them in bread, and wine, and in money every day forty sides: and their officers also oppressed the people. But I did not so for the fear of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.16"><v id="16"></v>Moreover I built in the work of the wall, and I bought no land, and all my servants were gathered together to the work. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.5.17"><v id="17"></v>The Jews also and the magistrates to the number of one hundred and fifty men, were at my table, besides them that came to us from among the nations that were round about us. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.3"><v id="3"></v>And I sent messengers to them, saying: I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down, lest it be neglected whilst I come, and go down to you. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.4"><v id="4"></v>And they sent to me according to this word, four times: and I answered them after the same manner. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.5"><v id="5"></v>And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time according to the former word, and he had a letter in his hand written in this manner: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.6"><v id="6"></v>It is reported amongst the Gentiles, and Gossem hath said it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, and therefore thou buildest the wall, and hast a mind to set thyself king over them : for which end </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.7"><v id="7"></v>Thou hast also set up prophets, to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judea. The king will hear of these things: therefore come now, that we may take counsel together. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.8"><v id="8"></v>And I sent to them, saying: There is no such thing done as thou sayest: but thou feignest these things out of thy own heart. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.9"><v id="9"></v>For all these men thought to frighten us, thinking that our hands would cease from the work, and that we would leave off. Wherefore I strengthened my hands the more: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.10"><v id="10"></v>And I went into the house of Samaia the son of Delaia, the son of Metabeel privately. And he said: Let us consult together in the house of God in the midst of the temple: and let us shut the doors of the temple, for they will come to kill thee, and in the night they will come to slay thee. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.11"><v id="11"></v>And I said: Should such a man as I Bee? and who is there that being as I am, would go into the temple, to save his life? I will not go in. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.12"><v id="12"></v>And I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken to me as if he had been prophesying, and Tobias, and Sanaballat had hired him. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.13"><v id="13"></v>For he had taken money, that I being afraid should do this thing, and sin, and they might have some evil to upbraid me withal. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.14"><v id="14"></v>Remember me, O Lord, for Tobias and Sanaballat, according to their works of this kind: and Noadias the prophet, and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.15"><v id="15"></v>But the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of the month of Elul, in two and fifty days. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.16"><v id="16"></v>And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, that all nations which were round about us, were afraid, and were cast down within themselves, for they perceived that this work was the work of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.17"><v id="17"></v>Moreover in those days many letters were sent by the principal men of the Jews to Tobias, and from Tobias there came letters to them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.18"><v id="18"></v>For there were many in Judea sworn to him, because he was the son in law of Sechenias the son of Area, and Johanan his son had taken to wife the daughter of Mosollam the son of Barachias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.6.19"><v id="19"></v>And they praised him also before me, and they related my words to him: And Tobias sent letters to put me in fear. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.8.2"><v id="2"></v>Then Esdras the priest brought the law before the multitude of men and women, and all those that could understand, in the first day of the seventh month. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.8.10"><v id="10"></v>And he said to them: Go, eat fat meats, and drink sweet wine, and send portions to them that have not prepared for themselves: because it is the holy day of the Lord, and be not sad: for the joy of the Lord is our strength. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.8.17"><v id="17"></v>And all the assembly of them that were returned from the captivity, made tabernacles, and dwelt in tabernacles: for since the days of Josue the son of Nun the children of Israel had not done so, until that day: and there was exceeding great joy. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.9.26"><v id="26"></v>But they provoked thee to wrath, and departed from thee, and threw thy law behind their backs: and they killed thy prophets, who admonished them earnestly to return to thee : and they were guilty of great blasphemies. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.9.29"><v id="29"></v>And thou didst admonish them to re turn to thy law.

<p0><bcv bcv="16.9.33"><v id="33"></v>And thou art just in all things that have come upon us: because thou hast done truth, but we have done wickedly. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.9.34"><v id="34"></v>Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept thy law, and have not minded thy commandments, and thy testimonies which thou hast testified among them. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.9.35"><v id="35"></v>And they have not served thee in their kingdoms, and in thy manifold goodness, which thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land, which thou deliveredst before them, nor did they return from their most wicked devices. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.9.36"><v id="36"></v>Behold we ourselves this day are bondmen: and the land, which thou gavest our fathers, to eat the bread thereof, and the good things thereof, and we ourselves are servants in it. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.9.37"><v id="37"></v>And the fruits thereof grow up for the kings, whom thou hast set over us for our sins, and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our beasts, according to their will, and we are in great tribulation. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.24"><v id="24"></v>Now the chief of the Levites were Hasebia, Serebia, and Josue the son of Cedmihel: and their brethren by their courses, to praise and to give thanks ac- cording to the commandment of David the man of God, and to wait equally in order. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.25"><v id="25"></v>Mathania, and Becbecia, Obedia, and Mosollam, Telmon, Accub, were keepers of the gates and of the entrances before the gates. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.26"><v id="26"></v>These were in the days of Joacim the son of Josue, the son of Josedec, and in the days of Nehemias the governor, and of Esdras the priest and scribe. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.27"><v id="27"></v>And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, and to keep the dedication, and to rejoice with thanksgiving, and with singing, and with cymbals, and psalteries and harps. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.28"><v id="28"></v>And the sons of the singing men were gathered together out of the plain country about Jerusalem, and out of the villages of Nethuphati, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.29"><v id="29"></v>And from the house of Galgal, and from the countries of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singing men had built themselves villages round about Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.30"><v id="30"></v>And the priests and the Levites purified, and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.31"><v id="31"></v>And I made the princes of Juda go up upon the wall, and I appointed two great choirs to give praise. And they went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dunghill gate. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.32"><v id="32"></v>And after them went Osaias, and half of the princes of Juda, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.33"><v id="33"></v>And Azarias, Esdras, and Mosollam, Judas, and Benjamin, and Semeia, and Jeremias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.34"><v id="34"></v>And of the sons of the priests with trumpets, Zacharias the son of Jonathan. the son of Semeia, the son of Mathania; the son of Michaia, the son of Zechur, the son of Asaph, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.35"><v id="35"></v>And his brethren Semeia, and Azareel Malalai, Galalai, Maai, Nathanael, and Judas, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God: and Esdras the scribe before them at the fountain gate. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.36"><v id="36"></v>And they went up over against them by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall of the house of David, and to the water gate eastward: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.37"><v id="37"></v>And the second choir of them that gave thanks went on the opposite side, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, and upon the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.38"><v id="38"></v>And above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Emath, and even to the flock gate: and they stood still in the watch gate. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.39"><v id="39"></v>And the two choirs of them that gave praise stood still at the house of God, and I and the half of the magistrates with me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.40"><v id="40"></v>And the priests, Eliachim, Maasia, Miamin, Michea, Elioenai, Zacharia, Hanania with trumpets, </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.41"><v id="41"></v>And Maasia, and Semeia, and Eleazar, and Azzi, and Johanan, and Melchia, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sung loud, and Jezraia was their overseer: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.42"><v id="42"></v>And they sacrificed on that day great sacrifices, and they rejoiced: for God had made them joyful with great joy: their wives also and their children rejoiced, and the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.43"><v id="43"></v>They appointed also in that day men over the storehouses of the treasure, for the libations, and for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, that the rulers of the city might bring them in by them in honour of thanksgiving, for the priests and Levites: for Juda was joyful in the priests and Levites that assisted. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.44"><v id="44"></v>And they kept the watch of their God, and the observance of expiation, and the singing men, and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.45"><v id="45"></v>For in the days of David and Asaph from the beginning there were chief singers appointed, to praise with canticles, and give thanks to God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.12.46"><v id="46"></v>And all Israel, in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Nehemias gave portions to the singing men, and to the porters, day by day, and they sanctified the Levites, and the Levites sanctified the sons of Aaron. </bcv></p0>

<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.1"><v id="1"></v>And on that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people: and therein was found written, that the Ammonites and the Moabites should not come in to the church of God for ever: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.2"><v id="2"></v>Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water: and they hired against them Balaam, to curse them, and our God turned the curse into blessing. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.3"><v id="3"></v>And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated every stranger from Israel. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.4"><v id="4"></v>And over this thing was Eliasib the priest, who was set over the treasury of the house of our God, and was near akin to Tobias. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.5"><v id="5"></v>And he made him a great storeroom, where before him they laid up gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tithes of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, the portions of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the porters, and the firstfruits of the priests. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.6"><v id="6"></v>But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem, because in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I went to the king, and after certain days I asked the king: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.7"><v id="7"></v>And I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the evil that Eliasib had done for Tobias, to make him a storehouse in the courts of the house of God. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.8"><v id="8"></v>And it seemed to me exceeding evil. And I cast forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.9"><v id="9"></v>And I commanded and they cleansed the storehouses: and I brought thither again the vessels of the house of God, the sacrifice, and the frankincense. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.10"><v id="10"></v>And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: and that the Levites, and the singing men, and they that ministered were fled away every man to his own country: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.11"><v id="11"></v>And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates, and said: Why have we forsaken the house of God? And I gathered them together, and I made them to stand in their places. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.12"><v id="12"></v>And all Juda brought the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil into the storehouses. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.13"><v id="13"></v>And we set over the storehouses Selemias the priest, and Sadoc the scribe, and of the Levites Phadaia, and next to them Hanan the son of Zachur, the son of Mathania: for they were approved as faithful, and to them were committed the portions of their brethren. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.14"><v id="14"></v>Remember me, O my God, for this thing, and wipe not out my kindnesses, which I have done relating to the house of my God and his ceremonies. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.15"><v id="15"></v>In those days I saw in Juda some treading the presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and lading asses with wine, and grapes, and figs, and all manner of burthens, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. And I charged them that they should sell on a day on which it was lawful to sell. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.16"><v id="16"></v>Some Tyrians also dwelt there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares: and they sold them on the sabbaths to the children of Juda in Jerusalem. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.17"><v id="17"></v>And I rebuked the chief men of Juda, and said to them: What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath day? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.18"><v id="18"></v>Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought all this evil upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more wrath upon Israel by violating the sabbath. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.19"><v id="19"></v>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem were at rest on the sabbath day, I spoke: and they shut the gates, and I commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burthens on the sabbath day. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.20"><v id="20"></v>So the merchants, and they that sold all kinds of wares, stayed without Jerusalem once or twice. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.21"><v id="21"></v>And I charged them, and I said to them: Why stay you before the wall? if you do so another time, I will lay hands on you. And from that time they came no more on the sabbath. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.22"><v id="22"></v>I spoke also to the Levites that they should be purified, and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath day: for this also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.23"><v id="23"></v>In those days also I saw Jews that married wives, women of Azotus, and of Ammon, and of Moab. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.24"><v id="24"></v>And their children spoke half in the speech of Azotus, and could not speak the Jews' language, but they spoke according to the language of this and that people. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.25"><v id="25"></v>And I chid them, and laid my curse upon them. And I beat some of them, and shaved off their hair, and made them swear by God that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying: </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.26"><v id="26"></v>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin in this kind of thing? and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: m and yet women of other countries brought even him to sin. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.27"><v id="27"></v>And shall we also be disobedient and do all this great evil to transgress against our God, and marry strange women? </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.28"><v id="28"></v>And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliasib the high priest, was son in law to Sanaballat the Horonite, and I drove him from me. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.29"><v id="29"></v>Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood, and the law of priests and Levites. </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.30"><v id="30"></v>So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his ministry : </bcv></p0>
<p0><bcv bcv="16.13.31"><v id="31"></v>And for the offering of wood at times appointed, and for the firstfruits: remember me, O my God, unto good. Amen.</bcv></p0>
